`` He was the on ' man for the job , ''

`` An ' they have n't invented a spell our Hermione can ' do , '' 
`` Well , I don ' blame yeh fer tryin ' ter curse him , Ron , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Don ' think he did , '' 
`` Come an ' see what I 've bin growin ' , '' 
`` Gettin ' on well , are n't they ? '' 
`` That 's what yer little sister said , '' 
`` Met her jus ' yesterday . '' 
`` Watch it ! '' 
`` What 're you doing in here ? '' 
`` Oh , ''

`` But as all twelve of us have voted - '' 
'' All righ ' , Harry ? Ready fer the off ? '' 
`` My job 's ter get you there safe , Harry ! '' 
`` Hold on , Harry , this 'll do it for ’em ! '' 
`` This 'll do it , Harry , hold on tight ! '' 
`` It 's all righ ' , Harry ! '' 
`` I 'm on it , Harry , don ' worry ! '' 
`` I 'm comin ' , Harry ! '' 
`` Harry , I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , '' 
`` I should n’ta tried ter repair it myself -- yeh 've got no room -- '' 
`` It 's not a problem , just keep flying ! '' 
`` Harry , what 's happened ? '' 
`` Where 've they gone ? '' 
`` Wait a moment , '' 
`` Have n't go ' any brandy , have yeh , Molly ? '' 
`` Oi ! '' 
`` Wha ' was that ' about ? '' 
`` So why aren ' you checkin ' me ? '' 
'' ` Yer not goin ' anywhere , '' 
`` Wait till it gets out yeh did it again , Harry , '' 
`` Harry , yer here ! Yer here ! '' 
`` I 'll see 524 CHAPTER 31 . THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS yer in a moment , there 's a good lad ! '' 
`` Blimey , Harry , ''

`` Yeah , '' 
`` I don ' want ter spoil it fer yeh , '' 
`` But it 's gon na be spectacular , I 'll tell yeh that . Them champions 're going ter have their work cut out . Never thought I 'd live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again ! ''

`` Eh ? '' 
`` Er -- eau de cologne , '' 
`` Roun ' the middle , '' 
`` Er -- yeh might want ter put on yer dragon-hide gloves , jus ' as an extra precaution , like . Harry -- you come here an ' help me with this big one ... '' 
`` ' Course I do , '' 
`` Look like they 're havin ' fun , don ' they ? '' 
`` Ah , I don ' know , Harry , '' 
`` All right , Hermione ? '' 
`` And it 's come in useful at times , I can tell you . '' 
`` Nice ter see yeh , Hermione , '' 
`` You there , Harry ? '' 
`` Got summat ter show yeh , '' 
`` Come with me , keep quiet , an ' keep yerself covered with that cloak , '' 
`` We won ' take Fang , he won ' like it ... '' 
`` Listen , Hagrid , I ca n't stay long ... I 've got to be back up at the castle by one o’clock -- '' 
`` Shhh ! '' 
`` Bong-sewer , '' 
`` Yeh 'll enjoy this , '' 
`` worth seein ' , trust me . On ' y -- don ' go tellin ' anyone I showed yeh , right ? Yeh 're not s ' posed ter know . '' 
`` Is ’n’ it beautiful ? '' 
`` Wan ' a closer look ? '' 
`` What breeds you got here , Charlie ? '' 
`` Jus ' thought she 'd like ter see ’em , '' 
`` Four ... '' 
`` so it 's one fer each o ' the champions , is it ? What 've they got ta do -- fight ’em ? '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` She didn ' seem very int 're sted in magical creatures , ter tell yeh the truth , '' 
`` She jus ' wanted me ter talk about you , Harry , '' 
`` But he 's not ! '' 
`` Said that , did he ? '' 
`` Though ' I might look in on it , yeah , '' 
`` I -- I do n't know what you mean , ' Agrid ... '' 
`` It was my mother , '' 
`` Me dad was broken-hearted when she wen ' . Tiny little bloke , my dad was . By the time I was six I could lift him up an ' put him on top o ' the dresser if he annoyed me . Used ter make him laugh ... '' 
`` Dad raised me ... but he died , o ' course , jus ' after I started school . Sorta had ter make me own way after that . Dumbledore was a real help , mind . Very kind ter me , he was ... '' 
`` Eh ? '' 
`` Another half-giant , o ' course ! '' 
`` I just meant -- Hagrid , how could you think we 'd care what that -- woman -- wrote about you ? '' 
`` I have shown you the letters from the countless parents who remember you from their own days here , telling me in no uncertain terms that if I sacked you , they would have something to say about it -- '' 
`` Not all of ’em , '' 
`` Yeh -- yeh 're not half-giant ! '' 
`` Great man , Dumbledore ... great man ... '' 
`` Yeah , he is , '' 
`` Help yerself , '' 
`` Tha ' was taken jus ' after I got inter Hogwarts , '' 
`` Come on ... Care of Magical Creatures . '' 
`` Easier ter spot than the adults , '' 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
`` Bin havin ' a cuppa with Olympe , '' 
`` Madame Maxime , o ' course ! '' 
`` Dunno what yeh 're talkin ' about , '' 
`` No , yeh 're not , '' 
`` Knew he was goin ' ter come back , '' 
`` Known it fer years , Harry . Knew he was out there , bidin ' his time . It had ter happen . Well , now it has , an ' we 'll jus ' have ter get on with it . We 'll fight . Migh ' be able ter stop him before he gets a good hold . That 's Dumbledore 's plan , anyway . Great man , Dumbledore . 'S long as we 've got him , I 'm not too worried . '' 
`` What 's comin ' will come , an ' we 'll meet it when it does . Dumbledore told me wha ' you did , Harry . '' 
`` Got a little job fer me over the summer , '' 
`` Is it to do with Voldemort ? '' 
`` I know , jus ' like old times , innit ? See , the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o ' Aurors , but Dumbledore said I 'd do , '' 
`` Jus ' passin ' through today , Tom , sure yeh understand , Hogwarts business , yeh know . '' 
`` Don ' fret , they 'll be fine with me , Molly , '' 
`` Migh ' be a bit of a squeeze in there with all of us , '' 
`` Got ev ' rything ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` I don ' believe this , '' 
`` Someone couldn ' have a grudge against the Gryffindor Quidditch team , could they ? '' 
`` It 's terrible , '' 
`` I 's pect he 's got hundreds of ideas , brain like his , '' 
`` But he doesn ' know who sent that necklace nor put poison in that wine , or they 'd 've bin caught , wouldn ' they ? Wha ' worries me , '' 
`` Got ta see it from their point o ' view , '' 
`` I mean , it 's always bin a bit of a risk sendin ' a kid ter Hogwarts , hasn ' it ? Yer expect accidents , don ' yeh , with hundreds of underage ELF TAILS ` 405 ` wizards all locked up tergether , but attempted murder , tha 's diff 're nt . 'S ’n o wonder Dumbledore 's angry with Sn -- '' 
`` I never said tha ' , '' 
`` Shhhh ! '' 
`` I dunno , Harry , it sounded like Snape was feelin ' a bit overworked , tha 's all -- anyway , Dumbledore told him flat out he 'd CHAPTER NINETEEN ` 406 ` agreed ter do it an ' that was all there was to it . Pretty firm with him . An ' then he said summat abou ' Snape makin ' investigations in his House , in Slytherin . Well , there 's nothin ' strange abou ' that ! '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` No it won ' , Filch , '' 
`` I 'm a ruddy teacher , aren ' I , yeh sneakin ' Squib ! '' 
`` Get goin ' , '' 
`` Look at this , '' 
`` Yeh came , '' 
`` Don ' -- don ' matter ... He 'd 've bin touched yeh 're here , though , Harry ... '' 
`` Blimey , no , '' 
`` Never bin an area o ' the forest I couldn ' go before ! '' 
`` Not in trouble , are yeh ? '' 
`` I shall have to see the Ministry when they get here . Hagrid , please tell the Heads of Houses -- Slughorn can represent Slytherin -- that I want to see them in my office forthwith . I would like you to join us too . '' 
`` What are your views , ought Hogwarts to remain open ? '' 
`` I dunno , Professor ... that 's fer the Heads of House an ' the headmistress ter decide ... '' 
`` Professor Dumbledore always valued your views , '' 
`` Yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog 's Head , '' 
`` Bin home three seconds ... Out the way , Fang ... Out the way , yeh dozy dog ... '' 
`` Merlin 's beard , keep it down ! '' 
`` It 's nuthin ' , it 's nuthin ' ! '' 
`` Told yeh , nuthin ' , '' 
`` I 'm tellin ' yeh , I 'm fine , '' 
`` Fer the las ' time , it 's nuthin ' ! '' 
`` I 'm dealin ' with it , all righ ' ? '' 
`` It 's s ' posed ter look like that , it 's dragon meat , '' 
`` Giants ? '' 
`` Oh , yeh did , did yeh ? '' 
`` Well , they 're not that difficult ter find , ter be honest , '' 
`` Mountains , '' 
`` They do , '' 
`` Tell us about being attacked by the giants and Harry can tell you about being attacked by the dementors -- '' 
`` Whadda yeh mean , attacked by dementors ? '' 
`` Tell us about your summer and I 'll tell you about mine . '' 
`` Oh , all righ ' , '' 
`` Yeah , tha 's right , '' 
`` Yeah , it was jus ' the pair of us . An ' I 'll tell yeh this , she 's not afraid of roughin ' it , Olympe . Yeh know , she 's a fine , well-dressed woman , an ' knowin ' where we was goin ' I wondered ' ow she 'd feel abou ' clamberin ' over boulders an ' sleepin ' in caves an ' tha ' , bu ' she never complained once . '' 
`` You knew where you were going ? '' 
`` Well , Dumbledore knew , an ' he told us , '' 
`` Not really , '' 
`` But -- why could n't you just grab a Portkey or something ? '' 
`` Yeh don ' understand , '' 
`` Well , not exactly all the way , '' 
`` We had ter lay off the magic once we got near ’em . Partly ’cause they don ' like wizards an ' we didn ' want ter put their backs up too soon , and partly ’cause Dumbledore had warned us Voldemort was bound ter be after the giants an ' all . Said it was odds on he 'd sent a messenger off ter them already . Told us ter be very careful of drawin ' attention ter ourselves as we got nearer in case there was Death Eaters around . '' 
`` Found ’em , '' 
`` ' Bout twenty feet , '' 
`` I reckon abou ' seventy or eighty , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` eighty left , an ' there was loads once , musta bin a hundred diff 're nt tribes from all over the world . But they 've bin dyin ' out fer ages . Wizards killed a few , o ' course , but HAGRID 'S TALE ` 427 ` mostly they killed each other , an ' now they 're dyin ' out faster than ever . They 're not made ter live bunched up together like tha ' . Dumbledore says it 's our fault , it was the wizards who forced ’em to go an ' made ’em live a good long way from us an ' they had no choice but ter stick together fer their own protection . '' 
`` Well , we waited till morning , didn ' want ter go sneakin ' up on ’em in the dark , fer our own safety , '' 
`` Well , like I say , they 're not meant ter live together , giants , '' 
`` Not in big groups like that . They can ' help themselves , they half kill each other every few weeks . The men fight each other an ' CHAPTER TWENTY ` 430 ` the women fight each other , the remnants of the old tribes fight each other , an ' that 's even without squabbles over food an ' the best fires an ' sleepin ' spots . Yeh 'd think , seein ' as how their whole race is abou ' finished , they 'd lay off each other , but ... '' 
`` That night a fight broke out , we saw it from the mouth of our cave , lookin ' down on the valley . Went on fer hours , yeh wouldn ' believe the noise . An ' when the sun came up the snow was scarlet an ' his head was lyin ' at the bottom o ' the lake . '' 
`` Karkus 's , '' 
`` ' Course we did , '' 
`` Well I ... I don ' know why that 'd be ... '' 
`` Term started more than two months ago . Another teacher has had to cover your classes . None of your colleagues has been able to give me any information as to your whereabouts . You left no address . Where have you been ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` bit o ' -- o ' fresh air , yeh know -- '' 
`` Yes , as gamekeeper fresh air must be so difficult to come by , '' 
`` Mountains ? '' 
`` Yeah ... well ... sensitive skin , '' 
`` Righ ' , '' 
`` You 're inspectin ' us ? '' 
`` She might not be gone yet . '' 
`` Oh , don ' you worry abou ' that , I 've got a great load o ' lessons planned , '' 
`` I 'm not sayin ' , '' 
`` But tha 's not very interestin ' , Hermione , '' 
`` Umbridge is looking for any excuse to get rid of teachers she thinks are too close to Dumbledore . Please , Hagrid , teach us something dull that 's bound to come up in our O.W.L. ... '' 
`` We 're workin ' in here today ! '' 
`` Ready ? '' 
`` ' Course they 're trained , '' 
`` Mind yer own business ! '' 
`` Gather roun ' , gather roun ' , '' 
`` Oh , an ' here comes another one ! '' 
`` Thestrals , '' 
`` They 're supposed to bring all sorts of horrible misfortune on people who see them . Professor Trelawney told me once -- '' 
`` No , no , no , '' 
`` tha 's jus ' superstition , that is , they aren ' unlucky , they 're dead clever an ' useful ! ' Course , this lot don ' get a lot o ' work , it 's mainly jus ' pullin ' the school carriages unless Dumbledore 's takin ' a long journey an ' don ' want ter Apparate -- an ' here 's another couple , look -- '' 
`` Don ' worry , it won ' hurt yeh , '' 
`` Go on then , '' 
`` Tha 's exactly right , '' 
`` ten points ter Gryffindor . Now , thestrals -- '' 
`` Oh hello ! '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` What did you say ? '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` No -- come on ! '' 
`` Please continue teaching as usual . I am going to walk '' 
`` I know what you 're doing , you awful , twisted , vicious -- '' 
`` Erm ... anyway , '' 
`` so -- thestrals . Yeah . Well , there 's loads o ' good stuff abou ' them ... '' 
`` Would it kill her to tell us what she 's up to for once ? It 'd take her about ten more seconds -- hey , Hagrid ! '' 
`` Fine , fine , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Oh , it 's you , Harry , '' 
`` Me ? '' 
`` In the same boat , you an ' me , aren ' we , Harry ? '' 
`` Yeah ... I 've said it before ... Both outsiders , like , '' 
`` Family , '' 
`` Eh ? '' 
`` Oh ... tha 's jus ' normal bumps an ' bruises , Harry , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` No , Harry , it 's got ta be now ... while ev ' ryone 's lookin ' the other way ... Please ? '' 
`` I ' ppreciate this , you two , I really do , '' 
`` Yeah , well , a bit o ' trouble wouldn ' hurt , '' 
`` Yeh -- yeh 'll see in a mo ' , '' 
`` Good ... good ... '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Jus ' a precaution , '' 
`` Nah , well , we weren ' goin ' in so far then , '' 
`` ’Cause the other centaurs are good an ' riled at me , tha 's why , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` ' Course I did , could n't stand by an ' watch ’em kill him , could I ? '' 
`` Ah no , '' 
`` no , it 's not them ... Well , o ' course , they could complicate the problem , yeah ... But yeh 'll see what I mean in a bit ... '' 
`` Bit further , '' 
`` C’mon , Harry ... We need ter keep together now ... '' 
`` Er ... all righ ' , '' 
`` Maybe we bes ' jus ' stop fer a momen ' , so I can ... fill yeh in , '' 
`` Righ , '' 
`` No , it ruddy well wasn ' ! '' 
`` What do you want us to do ? '' 
`` I knew yeh 'd say yes , '' 
`` but I won ' ... never ... forget ... Well ... c 'm on ... jus ' a little bit further through here ... Watch yerselves , now , there 's nettles ... '' 
`` Sleepin ' , '' 
`` Well -- no -- he didn ' want ter come , '' 
`` I knew if I jus ' got him back , '' 
`` an ' -- an ' taught him a few manners -- I 'd be able ter take him outside an ' show ev ' ryone he 's harmless ! '' 
`` He don ' know his own strength ! '' 
`` They were all bullyin ' him , Hermione , ’cause he 's so small ! '' 
`` Hermione , I couldn ' leave him , '' 
`` Well -- half-brother , '' 
`` Yeah ... well , tha 's what it sounds like when he says his name , '' 
`` She -- well , she could see it was right importan ' ter me , '' 
`` Well , tha 's why it took so long , see , '' 
`` Well , now -- ` violent ' -- tha 's a bit harsh , '' 
`` Well ... yeah ... '' 
`` Look after him , '' 
`` Not food or anythin ' ! '' 
`` Yeah -- even if yeh jus ' talk ter him a bit , '' 
`` Yeh 'll do it , then ? '' 
`` We 'll try , Hagrid ... '' 
`` I knew I could count on yeh , Harry , '' 
`` All righ ' , Grawpy ? '' 
`` Anyway , Grawpy , '' 
`` I 've brought some friends ter meet yeh . Remember , I told yeh I might ? Remember , when I said I might have ter go on a little trip an ' leave them ter look after yeh fer a bit ? Remember that , Grawpy ? '' 
`` Now , Grawpy , don ' do that ! '' 
`` I got company fer yeh ! '' 
`` This , '' 
`` An ' this is Hermione , see ? Her -- '' 
`` Righ ' , '' 
`` Hold it , '' 
`` Oh blimey , '' 
`` How are yeh , Magorian ? '' 
`` ` This human ' now , am I ? '' 
`` I dunno how yeh work that out , '' 
`` Servitude ! '' 
`` If yeh say so , '' 
`` but personally I think yeh 're makin ' a big mistake -- '' 
`` As are you , human , '' 
`` coming back into our forest when we warned you -- '' 
`` Now , you listen ter me , '' 
`` I won ' be kept outta the fores ' by a bunch of mules like you ! '' 
`` Reasonable be damned , yeh won ' take me like this , Dawlish ! '' 
`` Look ! '' 
`` COWARDS ! '' 
`` All right , you three ? '' 
`` No one ? '' 
`` Good man , Harry ! '' 
`` Easy -RRB- now , Harry , '' 
`` Tha 's it , '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` C'min . '' 
`` Not yet , '' 
`` Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could , '' 
`` YEH 'RE NOT TO GO WANDERIN ' AROUND AFTER DARK , HARRY ! AN , YOU TWO ! LETTIN ' HIM ! '' 
`` C'mon ! '' 
`` Black and Potter . Ringleaders of their little gang . Both very bright , of course -- exceptionally bright , in fact -- but I do n't think we 've ever had such a pair of troublemakers -- '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` He did indeed . Black was tired of his double-agent role , he was ready to declare his support openly for Voldemort , and he seems to have planned this for the moment of the Potters ' death . But , as we all know , 172 Voldemort met his downfall in little Harry Potter . Powers gone , horribly weakened , he fled . And this left Black in a very nasty position indeed . His master had fallen at the very moment when he , Black , had shown his true colors as a traitor . He had no choice but to run for it -- '' 
`` Filthy , stinkin ' turncoat ! '' 
`` I met him ! '' 
`` I musta bin the last ter see him before he killed all them people ! It was me what rescued Harry from Lily an ' James 's house after they was killed ! jus ' got him outta the ruins , poor little thing , with a great slash across his forehead , an ' his parents dead ... an ' Sirius Black turns up , on that flyin ' motorbike he used ter ride . Never occurred ter me what he was doin ' there . I didn ' know he 'd bin Lily an ' James 's Secret-Keeper . Thought he 'd jus ' heard the news o ' Voldemort 's attack an ' come ter see what he could do . White an ' shakin ' , he was . An ' yeh know what I did ? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN ' TRAITOR ! '' 
`` But what if I 'd given Harry to him , eh ? I bet he 'd 've pitched him off 173 the bike halfway out ter sea . His bes ' friends ' son ! But when a wizard goes over ter the Dark Side , there 's nothin ' and no one that matters to em anymore ... '' 
`` They 've got it in fer interestin ' creatures ! '' 
`` I couldn ' leave him tied up out there in the snow ! '' 
`` Wo n't make no diff ` rence ! '' 
`` Them Disposal devils , they 're all in Lucius 's pocket ! Scared o ' him ! Ad if I lose the case , Buckbeak -- '' 
`` He 's done more 'n enough fer me already , '' 
`` Ruddy brilliant ! '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` Because her cat acted like all cats do , '' 
`` I 'm not blamin ' yeh ! '' 
`` Ah , well , people can be a bit stupid abou ' their pets , '' 
`` They ca n't do this , '' 
`` S'no good , Ron , '' 
`` That Committee 's in Lucius 's pocket . I 'm jus ' gon na make sure the rest o ' Beaky 's time is the happiest he 's ever had . I owe him that ... '' 
`` Yeh beat 'em , Harry , yeh beat 'em ! Wait till I tell Buckbeak ! '' 
`` Beaky 's gettin ' a bit depressed , '' 
`` Dear , dear , I 'm getting too old for this ... Two o'clock , is n't it , Fudge ? '' 
'' said Hermione hesitantly . I -- I took him outside , '' 
`` It 's Okay , Beaky , it 's okay ... '' 
'' '' 
`` Leavin ' , isn ' he ? '' 
`` It 's gettin ' late and we 've got lots ter do tomorrow , '' 
`` Pay him , '' 
`` He wants payin ' fer deliverin ' the paper . Look in the pockets . '' 
`` Give him five Knuts , '' 
`` Mm ? '' 
`` Do n't worry about that , '' 
`` Yeah -- so yeh 'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , I 'll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- ` cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ' fact , I got ta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business . '' 
`` Welcome , '' 
`` to Diagon Alley . '' 
`` Yeah , you 'll be needin ' one , '' 
`` but we got ta get yer money first . '' 
`` Yeah , that 's a goblin , '' 
`` Like I said , Yeh 'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , '' 
`` Morning , '' 
`` Got it here somewhere , '' 
`` Got it , '' 
`` An ' I 've also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore , '' 
`` I will have Someone take you down to both vaults . Griphook ! '' 
`` Ca n't tell yeh that , '' 
`` You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet , '' 
`` All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander ... but I do n't know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I 'm famous and I ca n't even remember what I 'm famous for . I do n't know what happened when Vol - , sorry -- I mean , the night my parents died . '' 
`` Don ' you worry , Harry . You 'll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you 'll be just fine . just be yerself . I know it 's hard . Yeh 've been singled out , an ' that 's always hard . But yeh 'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do , ` smatter of fact . '' 
`` Rubbish ! '' 
`` How 's yer brother Charlie ? '' 
`` Bin watchin ' from me hut , '' 
`` But it is n't the same as bein ' in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? '' 
`` Kept outta trouble , though , that 's somethin' , '' 
`` Dunno what Harry thinks he 's doing , '' 
`` Ca n't have , '' 
`` Rubbish , '' 
`` He tried to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it 's guarding . '' 
`` I 'm tellin ' yeh , yer wrong ! '' 
`` He was provoked , Professor Snape , '' 
`` Come on , cheer up , it 's nearly Christmas , '' 
`` Tell yeh what , come with me an ' see the Great Hall , looks a treat . '' 
`` How many days you got left until yer holidays ? '' 
`` The library ? '' 
`` You what ? '' 
`` And we know what that dog 's guarding , it 's a Sorcerer 's St -- '' 
`` Shhhh ! '' 
`` Who is it ? '' 
`` We were wondering if you could tell us what 's guarding the Sorcerer 's Stone apart from Fluffy . '' 
`` Is n't he beautiful ? '' 
`` Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! '' 
`` I ca n't , '' 
`` I 've decided to call him Norbert , '' 
`` How about it , Hagrid ? '' 
`` He 's got lots o ' rats an ' some brandy fer the journey , '' 
`` Bye-bye , Norbert ! '' 
`` Should 've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n't you ? '' 
`` Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , '' 
`` But this is servant stuff , it 's not for students to do . I thought we 'd be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he 'd tell yer that 's how it is at Hogwarts , '' 
`` Right then , '' 
`` now , listen carefully , 'cause it 's dangerous what we 're gon na do tonight , an ' I don ' want no one takin ' risks . Follow me over here a moment . '' 
`` Look there , '' 
`` see that stuff shinin ' on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That 's unicorn blood . There 's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat . This is the second time in a week . I found one dead last Wednesday . We 're gon na try an ' find the poor thing . We might have ter put it out of its misery . '' 
`` There 's nothin ' that lives in the forest that 'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , '' 
`` All right , but I warn yeh , he 's a coward , '' 
'' So me , Harry , an ' Hermione 'll go one way an ' Draco , Neville , an ' Fang 'll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we 'll send up green sparks , right ? Get yer wands out an ' practice now -- that 's it -- an ' if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ' we 'll all come an ' find yeh -- so , be careful -- let 's go . '' 
`` Not fast enough , '' 
`` You all right , Hermione ? '' 
`` Don ' worry , it ca n't 've gone far if it 's this badly hurt , an ' then we 'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! '' 
`` That wasn ' no werewolf an ' it wasn ' no unicorn , neither , '' 
`` Who 's there ? '' 
`` Oh , it 's you , Ronan , '' 
`` Ca n't be too careful , Ronan , '' 
`` Hullo , Bane , '' 
`` We 've heard , '' 
`` Never , '' 
`` try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ' closer 'n the moon . '' 
`` You two wait here ! '' 
`` We 'll be lucky ter catch anythin ' now , with the racket you two were makin ' . Right , we 're changin ' groups -- Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ' this idiot . I 'm sorry , '' 
`` Who is it ? ''
