`` Wait , '' 
`` If you have n't got the guts to finish them , then leave them in the courtyard for me . '' 
`` Here ? In this Muggle dunghill ? We must be the first of our kind ever to set foot -- '' 
`` Let go , Bella ! '' 
`` Cissy , your own sister ? You would n't -- '' 
`` There is nothing I would n't do anymore ! '' 
`` Narcissa ! '' 
`` Now ... you came to ask me for help , Narcissa ? '' 
`` The Dark Lord has forbidden me to speak of it , '' 
`` The Dark Lord 's word is law . '' 
`` It so happens that I know of the plan , '' 
`` I thought you must know about it ! '' 
`` The Dark Lord is granting him a great honor . And I will say this for Draco : He is n't shrinking away from his duty , he seems glad of a chance to prove himself , excited at the prospect -- '' 
`` But he wo n't succeed ! '' 
`` Then I am right , he has chosen Draco Malfoy in revenge ! '' 
`` If I had sons , I would be glad to give them up to the service of the Dark Lord ! '' 
`` Certainly , Narcissa , I shall make the Unbreakable Vow , '' 
`` And , should it prove necessary ... if it seems Draco Malfoy will fail ... '' 
`` will you carry out the deed that the Dark Lord has ordered Draco Malfoy to perform ? '' 
`` Madam -- please -- '' 
`` It 's all right , Draco , '' 
`` You 're right , Draco , ''
