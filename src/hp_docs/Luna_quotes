`` Ron can laugh , '' 
`` Oh , it 's fine , '' 
`` Ron , please stay still ! '' 
`` Oh , that 's much easier , thanks , Ron , '' 
`` There 's no way out , Ron , '' 
`` Harry , we want to help you ! '' 
`` ... and tiny little ears , '' 
`` a bit like hippo 's , Daddy says , only purple and hairy . And if you want to call them , you have to hum ; they prefer a waltz , nothing too fast ... '' 
`` ... and if you ever come to our house I 'll be able to show you the horn , Daddy wrote to me about it but I have n't seen it yet , because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas , '' 
`` That horn exploded . It came from an Erumpent , not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack -- '' 
`` No , it was definitely a Snorkack horn , '' 
`` Daddy told me . It will probably have re -- formed by now , they mend themselves , you know . '' 
`` I 'm going to miss you , Mr. Ollivander , '' 
`` Daddy 's made a tiara , '' 
`` Well , more of a crown , really . '' 
`` What 's happened , what 's happened ? '' 
`` Very well , thank you , '' 
`` Oh yes , circulation 's well up , '' 
`` Are we still doing D.A. meetings this year , Harry ? '' 
`` I enjoyed the meetings too , '' 
`` It was like having friends . '' 
`` People expect you to have cooler friends than us , '' 
`` That 's a very nice thing to say , '' 
`` Wrackspurt got you ? '' 
`` Oh , hello , Harry , '' 
`` Hi , Luna . Hermione , you left your stuff ... '' 
`` She 's a bit upset , '' 
`` He says very funny things sometimes , does n't he ? '' 
`` Oh , it 's been all right , '' 
`` Oh , no , I 'd love to go with you as friends ! '' 
`` Rufus Scrimgeour ? '' 
`` Yes , he 's a vampire , '' 
`` Hello , '' 
`` I have n't seen you in my classes lately ... '' 
`` No , I 've got Firenze this year , '' 
`` I do n't think you should be an Auror , Harry , '' 
`` And Harry Potter 's now having an argument with his Keeper , '' 
`` Is it , already ? '' 
`` I went to the hospital wing to find you , '' 
`` I believe He-Who-MustNot-Be-Named is back , and I believe you fought him and escaped from him . '' 
`` You can laugh ! '' 
`` There were n't any such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack . '' 
`` Well , that makes sense . After all , Cornelius Fudge has got his own private army . '' 
`` Yes , he 's got an army of heliopaths , '' 
`` Yes , he has , '' 
`` They 're spirits of fire , '' 
`` Oh yes they do ! '' 
`` Well , my father is very supportive of any anti-Ministry action ! '' 
`` I 'm supporting Gryffindor , '' 
`` It 's good , is n't it ? '' 
`` Weasley Is Our King '' 
`` My dad thinks it 's an awful paper , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` he 's the editor of The Quibbler . '' 
`` in a -- well , an unusual magazine -- I think they might be rather keen to read it . '' 
`` I do n't think Daddy exactly pays people to write for the magazine , '' 
`` Daddy will be pleased , '' 
`` And , of course , that 'll be a very important story , so Harry 's might have to wait for the following issue , '' 
`` escape . '' 
`` Who 's Grawp ? '' 
`` Well , we 'll have to fly , wo n't we ? '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` The Crumple-Horned Snorkack ca n't fly , '' 
`` but they can , and Hagrid says they 're very good at finding places their riders are looking for . '' 
`` I think there are six of us , actually , '' 
`` you 're not involved in this , you 're not -- '' 
`` Okay , fine , it 's your choice , '' 
`` There 's no need , '' 
`` Oh it 's easy , '' 
`` Whoever 's nearest the receiver , dial six two four four two ! '' 
`` Aquavirius maggots ! '' 
`` I can hear them too , '' 
`` You know what could be in there ? '' 
`` Daddy sold it to them , ''
