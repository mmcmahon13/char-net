`` Le ' go of him ! Le ' go of Harry ! '' 
`` What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts ? '' 
`` A -- a grindylow in a tank , was n't it ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry Harry , but I had to check '' 
`` You 're half -- giant , '' 
`` Voldemort caught up with you ? '' 
`` Yes , Harry , '' 
`` and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed that happening ! Forgive me , but it was a very unusual move then , under imminent threat of death . Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first occasion was close to suicidal ! '' 
`` Of course not , '' 
`` but the Death Eaters -- frankly , most people ! -- would have expected you to attack back ! Expelliarmus is a useful spell , Harry , but the Death Eaters seem to think it is your signature move , and I urge you not to let it become so ! '' 
`` That 's Voldemort 's job . '' 
`` We should n't be here , '' 
`` Harry -- I 'm sorry -- I 'll explain another time -- '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but we 're all being watched . There are a couple of Death Eaters in the square outside -- '' 
`` I 'd have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me , '' 
`` Impossible , '' 
`` Well , Kingsley saved us , '' 
`` A mixture ; but to all intents and purposes they 're the same thing now , '' 
`` That 's certainly part of it , '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard , '' 
`` I know . '' 
`` I thought you 'd say that , '' 
`` What about her ? '' 
`` Tonks will be perfectly safe . '' 
`` Everything is fine , thank you , '' 
`` So ... do you accept my offer ? Will three become four ? I can not believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved , he appointed my your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , after all . And I must tell you that I believe that we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined . '' 
`` She 'll be perfectly safe there , they 'll look after her , '' 
`` You do n't understand , '' 
`` Do n't you understand what I 've done to my wife and my unborn child ? I should never have married her , I 've made her an outcast ! '' 
`` You have only seen me amongst the Order , or under Dumbledore 's protection at Hogwarts ! You do n't know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me ! When they know of my affliction , they can barely talk to me ! Do n't you see what I 've done ? Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage , when parents want their only daughter to marry a werewolf ? And the child -- the child -- '' 
`` How -- how dare you ? '' 
`` The man who taught me to fight dementors -- a coward . '' 
`` Yes -- yes -- a boy , '' 
`` I ca n't stay long , I must get back , '' 
`` To Teddy Remus Lupin , '' 
`` a great wizard in the making ! '' 
`` Harry , what 's happening ? '' 
`` So -- ' ow eez leetle Teddy ? '' 
`` I -- oh yes -- he 's fine ! '' 
`` Here , I 've got a picture ! '' 
`` Molly , how about this , '' 
`` There have been another couple of dementor attacks , '' 
`` They 'll make do with other makers , '' 
`` No , I do n't think that Bill will be a true werewolf , '' 
`` but that does not mean that there wo n't be some contamination . Those are cursed wounds . They are unlikely ever to heal fully , and -- and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on . '' 
`` We all wondered ... but he trusted ... always ... Snape ... I ca n't believe it ... '' 
`` Snape was a highly accomplished Occlumens , '' 
`` It is n't your fault , Minerva , '' 
`` Luckily , '' 
`` Ron , Ginny , and Neville ran into us almost immediately and told us what had happened . We found the Death Eaters minutes later , heading in the direction of the Astronomy Tower . Malfoy obviously had n't expected more people to be on the watch ; he seemed to have exhausted his supply of Darkness Powder , at any rate . A fight broke out , they scattered and we gave chase . One of them , Gibbon , broke away and headed up the tower stairs -- '' 
`` He must have done , yes , they must have arranged that before they left the Room of Requirement , '' 
`` It 's not your fault , '' 
`` I saw him run straight through the cursed barrier as though it was n't there , '' 
`` Well , the big Death Eater had just fired off a hex that caused half the ceiling to fall in , and also broke the curse blocking the stairs , '' 
`` Oh , Bill ! '' 
`` There will probably be some contamination , Arthur , '' 
`` It 's different , '' 
`` And I 've told you a million times , '' 
`` that I am too old for you , too poor ... too dangerous ... '' 
`` I 've said all along you 're taking a ridiculous line on this , Remus , '' 
`` I am not being ridiculous , '' 
`` This is ... not the moment to discuss it , '' 
`` I 've ... I 've done it , Professor , '' 
`` Think about what you 've just memorized , '' 
`` Look after yourselves , '' 
`` He ca n't come back , Harry , '' 
`` Here , '' 
`` Let 's -- let 's find the others . Where are they all , Neville ? '' 
`` Harry -- no ! '' 
`` be careful ... '' 
`` Stay where you are , '' 
`` Here , '' 
`` A dementor , '' 
`` Eat , '' 
`` I have n't poisoned that chocolate , you know ... '' 
`` I 'd take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you , Peeves , '' 
`` Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me , '' 
`` I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is particularly complex . '' 
`` Pity sugar makes it useless , '' 
`` Did you tell Professor Snape we have n't covered them yet ? '' 
`` I heard about the match , '' 
`` and I 'm sorry about your broomstick . Is there any chance of fixing it ? '' 
`` The tree smashed it to bits . '' 
`` I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum . '' 
`` They 're getting hungry , '' 
`` There are -- certain defenses one can use , '' 
`` I do n't pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors , Harry , quite the contrary ... '' 
`` But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match , I need to be able to fight them -- '' 
`` Ah yes , '' 
`` Another boggart , '' 
`` Well , when it works correctly , It conjures up a Patronus , '' 
`` which is a kind of anti- dementor -- a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor . '' 
`` The Patronus is a kind of positive force , a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope , happiness , the desire to survive -- but it can not feel despair , as real humans can , so the dementors ca n't hurt it . But I must warn you , Harry , that the charm might be too advanced for you . Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it . '' 
`` The incantation is this -- '' 
`` Very good , '' 
`` Are you all right ? '' 
`` Here -- '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
`` Not now , '' 
`` Professor Lupin ? '' 
`` If you knew my dad , you must 've known Sirius Black as well . '' 
`` What gives you that idea ? '' 
`` Yes , I knew him , '' 
`` Well -- let 's drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw ! Not that I 'm 205 supposed to take sides , as a teacher ... '' 
`` They call it the Dementor 's Kiss , '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` Much worse than that . You can exist without your soul , you know , as long as your brain and heart are still working . But you 'll have no sense of self anymore , no memory , no . . . anything . There 's no chance at all of recovery . You 'll just exist . As an empty shell . And your soul is gone forever ... lost . '' 
`` It 's the fate that awaits Sirius Black . It was in the Daily Prophet this morning . The Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they find him . '' 
`` You think so ? '' 
`` You gave Lucius quite a fright , '' 
`` Excellent , Harry , '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` Since I did Professor Snape 's essay ... '' 
`` He 'll be delighted , '' 
`` But they already know , '' 
`` If you 'll give me a chance , I 'll explain . Look -- '' 
`` You 're armed , we 're not . Now will you listen ? '' 
`` The map , '' 
`` Of course I know how to work it , '' 
`` The important thing is , I was watching it carefully this evening , because I had an idea that you , Ron , and Hermione might try and sneak out of the castle to visit Hagrid before his hippogriff was executed . And I was right , was n't I '' 
`` The number of times I saw James disappearing under it ... , '' 
`` Everyone thought Sirius killed Peter , '' 
`` But Professor Lupin ... Scabbers ca n't be Pettigrew ... it just ca n't be true , you know it ca n't ... '' 
`` Why ca n't it be true ? '' 
`` Light again , Hermione ! '' 
`` All right ... but you 'll need to help me , Sirius , '' 
`` He 's here , Sirius , '' 
`` He 's teaching here as well . '' 
`` Sneaking around , trying to find out what we were up to ... hoping he could get us expelled ... '' 
`` Severus was very interested in where I went every month . '' 
`` Severus -- '' 
`` I 've told the headmaster again and again that you 're helping your old friend Black into the castle , Lupin , and here 's the proof . Not even I dreamed you would have the nerve to use this old place as your hideout -- '' 
`` Severus , you 're making a mistake , '' 
`` I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore takes this ... He was quite convinced you were harmless , you know , Lupin ... a tame werewolf -- '' 
`` You fool , '' 
`` I 'll drag the werewolf . Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too -- '' 
`` Oh , we 're going to be in so much trouble -- '' 
`` Thank you , Harry , '' 
`` I 'm still not saying I believe you , '' 
`` Then it 's time we offered you some proof , '' 
`` Come off it , '' 
`` Are you trying to say he broke out of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? I mean ... '' 
`` You know , Sirius , that 's a fair question , '' 
`` How did you get this ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Harry - '' 
`` And now you 've come to finish him off ! '' 
`` Enough of this , '' 
`` Force him to show himself , '' 
`` Ready , Sirius ? '' 
`` Together ? '' 
`` So we 've heard , '' 
`` No one 's going to try and kill you until we 've sorted a few things out , '' 
`` You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban ? '' 
`` Not if he thought I was the spy , Peter , '' 
`` I assume that 's why you did n't tell me , Sirius ? '' 
`` Not at all , Padfoot , old friend , '' 
`` Yes , I think so , ''
