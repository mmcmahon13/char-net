`` Sit , '' 
`` Explain , '' 
`` is obvious . '' 
`` I will not take any points from Gryffindor , '' 
`` You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory , '' 
`` I must also return to the feast . '' 
`` I see no reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch . This cat was n't hit over the head with a broomstick . There is no evidence at all that Potter has done anything wrong . '' 
`` The potion will be useless without Crabbe 's and Goyle 's hair , '' 
`` The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for you to receive your education , '' 
`` I have good news , '' 
`` Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready for cutting at last . Tonight , we will be able to revive those people who have been Petrified . I need hardly remind you all that one of them may well be able to tell us who , or what , attacked them . I am hopeful that this dreadful year will end with our catching the culprit . '' 
'' -LRB- ti agree , sir , '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` It has happened , '' 
`` left another message . Right underneath the first one . ` Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever . '' 
`` that 's got him out from under our feet . The Heads of Houses should go and inform their students what has happened . Tell them the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow . Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left outside their dormitories . '' 
`` I think all this merits a good feast . Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens ? '' 
`` You 're acting on Dumbledore 's orders ? '' 
`` we teachers are rather good at magic , you know . I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put out best efforts into it . Of course , something will have to be done about Professor Snape -- '' 
`` There 's something in that , '' 
`` Come . We must alert the other Heads of House . You 'd better put that Cloak back on . '' 
`` Who 's there ? '' 
`` Coward ! COWARD ! '' 
`` no , he 's not dead , '' 
`` Very well . He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming , '' 
`` I shall meet you in the Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House . '' 
`` Tentacula , Devil 's Snare . And Snargaluff pod ... yes , I 'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those . '' 
`` They 're supposed to be here , you blithering idiot ! '' 
`` Now , Potter , '' 
`` you and Miss Lovegood had better return to you friends and bring them to the Great Hall -- I shall rouse the other Gryffindors . '' 
`` but it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it . I must ask you , therefore , to move quickly and calmly , and so as your prefects -- '' 
`` Lily , Lily ! '' 
`` Gryffindor ! '' 
`` I 'd want some peace and quite , if it were me , '' 
`` I 'll distract them all , '' 
`` Oooh , look , a Blibbering Humdinger ! '' 
`` Really , what nonsense ! Harry could not have crossed the line himself , and as Professor Dumbledore believes that he did not persuade an older student to do it for him , I 'm sure that should be good enough for everybody else ! '' 
`` and the ball will start at eight oâ€™clock on Christmas Day , finishing at midnight in the Great Hall . Now then -- '' 
`` The Yule Ball is of course a chance for us all to -- er -- let our hair down , '' 
`` that we will be relaxing the standards of behavior we expect from Hogwarts students . I will be most seriously displeased if a Gryffindor student embarrasses the school in any way . '' 
`` Potter -- a word , if you please . '' 
`` Potter , the champions and their partners -- '' 
`` What partners ? '' 
`` Your partners for the Yule Ball , Potter , '' 
`` Champions over here , please ! '' 
`` Come along , Potter , '' 
`` Master Barty , Master Barty , what is you doing here ? '' 
`` Why are you disturbing these people ? Minerva , I 'm surprised at you -- I asked you to stand guard over Barty Crouch -- '' 
`` There is no need to stand guard over him anymore , Dumbledore ! '' 
`` The moment that -- that thing entered the room , '' 
`` I want to see Hagrid in my office as soon as possible . Also -- if she will consent to come -- Madame Maxime . '' 
`` Very -- very well , '' 
`` Forgot to brake , Professor , sorry . '' 
`` Molly and Arthur are on their way , '' 
`` I tried to follow him , but was thrown back just like Neville ... '' 
`` He must have known a spell we did n't , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` I would like to know what you and Professor Dumbledore were doing this evening when you left the school . '' 
`` I want to talk about what happens to Hogwarts before he gets here , '' 
`` and so do I. '' 
`` Well , I 'm stayin ' , '' 
`` What on earth are you shouting about , Potter ? '' 
`` Have a biscuit , Potter . '' 
`` Have a biscuit , '' 
`` Do you really think this is about truth or lies ? It 's about keeping your head down and your temper under control ! '' 
`` Have another biscuit , '' 
`` Do n't be ridiculous , '' 
`` Well , I 'm glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate , '' 
`` What you must remember , '' 
`` without serious application , practice , and study . I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an O.W.L. in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work . '' 
`` There 's nothing wrong with your work except lack of confidence . So ... today we are starting Vanishing Spells . These are easier than Conjuring Spells , which you would not usually attempt until N.E.W.T. level , but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your O.W.L. '' 
`` Are you telling me , '' 
`` that after the warning I gave you last Monday you lost your temper in Professor Umbridge 's class again ? '' 
`` No , not another word of complaint , Potter ! And as for you , Miss Johnson , you will confine your shouting matches to the Quidditch pitch in future or risk losing the team Captaincy ! '' 
`` Hurry up , you three , '' 
`` You have n't been given another detention ! '' 
`` London '' 
`` number twelve , Grimmauld Place '' 
`` Yes , Professor ? '' 
`` Bear in mind , '' 
`` that channels of communication in and out of Hogwarts may be being watched , wo n't you ? '' 
`` I think you 've got enough to be getting on with at the moment , '' 
`` In ! '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` You thought wrong , '' 
`` But unfortunately , '' 
`` it is what I think that counts , as they are in my House , Dolores . '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` Well , usually when a person shakes their head , '' 
`` they mean ` no . ' So unless Miss Edgecombe is using a form of sign language as yet unknown to humans -- '' 
`` has asked the Heads of House to tell their students that cheating will be punished most severely -- because , of course , your examination results will reflect upon the headmistress 's new regime at the school ... '' 
`` You may begin , '' 
`` I 'm quite as good as new . You two -- Crabbe -- Goyle -- '' 
`` well , I think Potter and his friends ought to have fifty points apiece for alerting the world to the return of You-KnowWho ! What say you , Professor Snape ? '' 
`` Oh -- and fifty for Miss Lovegood , I suppose , '' 
`` There 's no need to look so worried -- I just want a word in MY office , '' 
`` One moment , please ! '' 
`` Never quite in their league , talent-wise . I was often rather , harp with him . You can imagine how I - how I regret that now ... '' 
`` Stupid boy ... foolish boy ... he was always hopeless at dueling ... should have left it to the Ministry ... '' 
`` I tell yeh , if I 'd got ter Black before little Pettigrew did , I would n't 've messed around with wands -- I 'd 've ripped him limb -- from -- limb , '' 
`` But where is dear Professor Lupin ? '' 
`` An unworthy trick ! '' 
`` Which person , '' 
`` which abysmally foolish person wrote down this week 's passwords and left them lying around ? '' 
`` Yes -- yes , you 're right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? '' 
`` Out , Peeves ! '' 
`` Detention ! '' 
`` But Professor -- '' 
`` Potter , I know what I 'm talking about , ''
