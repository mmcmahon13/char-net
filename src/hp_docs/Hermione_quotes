`` You 're not telling me you did fly here ? '' 
`` It 's ` wattlebird , '' 
`` but that 's not the point - '' 
`` We 'll be repotting Man drakes today . Now , who can tell me the properties of the Man drake ? '' 
`` Mandrake , or Mandragora , is a powerful restorative , '' 
`` The Mandrake forms an essential part of most antidotes . It is also , however , dangerous . Who can tell me why ? '' 
`` The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it , '' 
`` Now , the Mandrakes we have here are still very young . '' 
`` cry ''

`` At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way in , '' 
`` Ron ! Ron ! Are you all right ? '' 
`` Nearly there , Ron , '' 
`` I do n't think there 's anything to do except wait for it to stop , '' 
`` I think you 're being a bit unfair . Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the job - '' 
`` He did , '' 
`` An Engorgement Charm , I suppose ? '' 
`` All that junk about Lockhart being so great - '' 
`` All the copies of Hogwarts , A History have been taken out , '' 
`` The same reason everyone else wants it , '' 
`` to read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets . '' 
`` That 's just it . I ca n't remember , '' 
`` No , I wo n't , '' 
`` Granger , Professor . I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the Chamber of Secrets , '' 
`` Naturally , the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber , many times , by the most learned witches and wizards . It does not exist . A tale told to frighten the gullible . '' 
`` What 's a boy in his class saying about you ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Dumbledore could n't cure * 1,5 % * Mrs. Norris , and that makes me think that whatever attacked her might not be - well - human . '' 
`` Come and look at this ! '' 
`` Have you ever seen spiders act like that ? '' 
`` I never knew that , '' 
`` Oh , Ron , there wo n't be anyone in there , '' 
`` That 's Moaning Myrtle 's place . Come on , let 's have a look . '' 
`` Hello , Myrtle , how are you ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I just wanted to show them how er - nice it is in here . '' 
`` I do have feelings , you know , even if I am dead - '' 
`` Myrtle , no one wants to upset you , '' 
`` We wanted to ask you if you 've seen anything funny lately , '' 
`` Honestly , that was almost cheerful for Myrtle ... Come on , let 's go . '' 
`` Who can it be , though ? '' 
`` Malfoy , the Heir of Slytherin ? '' 
`` There might be a way , '' 
`` All right , '' 
`` No , it 's not , '' 
`` It wears off after a while , '' 
`` I think , '' 
`` Oh , yes , '' 
`` Malfoy could have attacked half the Muggle - borns in the school by then ! '' 
`` What we need , '' 
`` is a diversion . Then one of us can sneak into Snape 's office and take what we need . '' 
`` I think Id better do the actual stealing , '' 
`` I wonder who 'll be teaching us ? '' 
`` Do you think he 's all right ? '' 
`` Hermione , I do n't think - '' 
`` That could go seriously wrong - '' 
`` I 've already got mine ! '' 
`` Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling Club ? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me ! And she 's gone home for Christmas - so I 'll just have to tell the Slytherins I 've decided to come back . '' 
`` Hermione ? '' 
`` Did you get them ? '' 
`` Good . And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry , '' 
`` I 'm sure I 've done everything right , '' 
`` We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs . '' 
`` Add yours , then , '' 
`` Hermione , come out , we 've got loads to tell you - '' 
`` Go away ! '' 
`` Do n't be silly , Ron , I 've got to keep up , '' 
`` And this diary is fifty years old , '' 
`` Oh , Ron , wake up , '' 
`` It might be invisible ink ! '' 
`` Aparecium ! '' 
`` It 's a Revealer , I got it in Diagon Alley , '' 
`` Prefect , Head Boy ... probably top of every class - '' 
`` You say that like it 's a bad thing , '' 
`` Tom Riddle might have got the wrong person , '' 
`` But the monster had killed someone , Ron , '' 
`` Your aunt and uncle will be proud , though , wo n't they ? '' 
`` It was my wand . My wand acted of its own accord . '' 
`` But that 's impossible , Harry . You mean that you did magic without meaning to , you reacted instinctively . '' 
`` Harry , come back in the house , '' 
`` Are you all right ? '' 
`` Hi , Harry , '' 
`` Oh , Ron 's mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday , '' 
`` Even if the Killing curse missed , Mad Eye still fell about a thousand feet , '' 
`` Of course we do n't want him to be dead ! '' 
`` Do n't ! '' 
`` Oh ... thanks , Ron ... I 'm sorry ... '' 
`` But you know what he 'd say to us if he was here ? '' 
`` He 'd tell us to learn from what happened to him . And what I 've learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit , Mundungus . '' 
`` I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! '' 
`` Just trying to decide which ones to take with us , '' 
`` Ha ha , '' 
`` I wonder ... will we need to translate runes ? It 's possible ... I think we 'd better take it , to be safe . '' 
`` As we knew he would , '' 
`` No , Harry , you listen , '' 
`` Let 's see , '' 
`` Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes , I 'll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment . If I do n't -- well , I think I 've cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy . Wendell and Monica Wilkins do n't know that they 've got a daughter , you see . '' 
`` But hopefully it 'll look like I 've gone away with Mum and Dad ; a lot of Muggle -- borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment , '' 
`` Dad is . He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul . Mum ... well , you 've seen what she 's like . She wo n't accept we 're going till we 've gone . '' 
`` Fleur 's sister 's a bridesmaid , she needs to be here for the rehearsal , and she 's too young to come on her own , '' 
`` what we really need to decide , '' 
`` is where we 're going after we leave here . I know you said you wanted to go to Godric 's Hollow first , Harry , and I understand why , but ... well ... should n't we make the Horcruxes our priority ? '' 
`` Do n't you think there 's a possibility that Voldemort 's keeping a watch on Godric 's Hollow ? '' 
`` Or she . '' 
`` Yes , but we 're still going to have to try and trace the real locket , are n't we ? '' 
`` to find out whether or not it 's destroyed . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I 've been researching that . '' 
`` There were n't , '' 
`` It -- it was n't stealing ! '' 
`` Well ... it was easy , '' 
`` Just after his -- Dumbledore 's -- funeral , '' 
`` Right after we agreed we 'd leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes . When I went back upstairs to get my things it -- it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them , the better it would be ... and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked . They flew straight in through the open window and I -- I packed them . '' 
`` I ca n't believe Dumbledore would have been angry , it 's not as though we 're going to use the information to make a Horcrux , is it ? '' 
`` Where are these books anyway ? '' 
`` And the more I 've read about them , '' 
`` the more horrible 93 they seem , and the less I can believe that he actually made six . It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it , and that 's just by making one Horcrux ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but it would be excruciatingly painful . '' 
`` Remorse , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` It does n't have to be a basilisk fang , '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Our problem is that the are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom , and they 're all dangerous to carry around with you . That 's a problem we 're going to have to solve though , because ripping , smashing , or crushing a Horcrux wo n't do the trick . You 've got to put it beyond magical repair . '' 
`` Look , if I picked up a sword right now , Ron , and ran you through with it , I would n't damage your soul at all . '' 
`` It should be , actually ! But my point is that whatever happens to your body , your soul will survive untouched , '' 
`` While the magical container is still intact , the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object . I do n't mean holding it for long , it 's nothing to do with touching it , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` we will ... we 're sorry ... '' 
`` Thank you , Ron ! '' 
`` We 're fine , '' 
`` How can you tell ? '' 
`` They 're a lot more vicious . '' 
'' can wait upstairs , I will start with Ronald . '' 
`` Is n't it obvious ? '' 
`` They wanted to examine whatever he 's left us . You had no right to do that ! '' 
`` The Decree for Justifi - able Confiscation gives the Ministry the power to confiscate the contents of a will -- '' 
`` That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts , '' 
`` and the Ministry is supposed to have evidence that the deceased 's possessions are illegal before seizing them ! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed ? '' 
`` No , I 'm not , '' 
`` No , it 'll be because the thirty-one days are up , '' 
`` Would you say you were close to Dumbledore , Ronald ? '' 
`` He ... he knew I liked books , '' 
`` No , I did n't , '' 
`` And if the Ministry still has n't found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days , I doubt that I will . '' 
`` Why is that ? '' 
`` Oh , it ca n't be a reference to the fact that Harry 's a great Seeker , that 's way too obvious , '' 
`` Because Snitches have flesh memories , '' 
`` That 's all , then , is it ? '' 
`` It belongs to Harry ! '' 
`` Muffliato , '' 
`` Times change , '' 
`` The thing is , '' 
`` we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder . '' 
`` Definitely , '' 
`` Well , exactly , '' 
`` I 've no idea , '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Do n't you remember ? '' 
`` And as for this book '' 
`` The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I 've never even heard of them . '' 
`` No , I 'm not . '' 
`` Excuse me ? '' 
`` Ron , you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles ! '' 
`` So these are children 's stories ? '' 
`` Always the tone of surprise , '' 
`` Well , then , you did what you were told , did n't you ? '' 
`` Oh , Kreacher ! '' 
`` Harry , Kreacher does n't think like that , '' 
`` He 's a slave ; house-elves are used to bad , even brutal treatment ; what Voldemort did to Kreacher was n't that far out of the common way . What do wizard wars mean to an elf like Kreacher ? He 's loyal to people who are kind to him , and Mrs. Black must have been , and Regulus certainly was , so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs . I know what you 're going to say , '' 
`` I do n't think so , '' 
`` or they 'd have sent Snape in after us , would n't they ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` otherwise he 'd have been able to tell that lot how to get in , would n't he ? But they 're probably watching to see whether we turn up . 175 176 CHAPTER 11 . THE BRIBE They know that Harry owns the house , after all . '' 
`` Will you stop it ! '' 
`` Oh , thank goodness , '' 
`` I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they would not see me . They ca n't know you 're in here or I 'm sure they 'd have more people out there ; they 're staking out everywhere that 's got any connection with you , Harry . Let 's go downstairs , there 's a lot to tell you , and I want to know what 's happened after you left the Burrow . '' 
`` We wondered , '' 
`` whether Harry could still have the Trace on him ? '' 
`` Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people ? '' 
`` I 'll teach you my family tree so you can answer questions on it . '' 
`` Ron , as we 're on the run with Harry Potter , the most wanted person in the country , I do n't think it matters . If I was going back to school it would be different . What 's Voldemort planning for Hogwarts ? '' 
`` But what about Tonks ? '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` you 're married : How does she feel about you going away with us ? '' 
`` Remus , '' 
`` is everything all right ... you know ... between you and -- '' 
`` Oh , how wonderful ! '' 
`` Remus ! '' 
`` Harry , no ! '' 
`` Remus , Remus , come back ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` No -- no -- we must n't fight ! '' 
`` Harry -- '' 
`` All the same ... '' 
`` I panicked , okay ? I never wanted to come along , no offense , mate , but I never volunteered to die for you , an ' that was bleedin ' Voldemort come flying at me , anyone woulda got outta there , I said all along I did n't wan na do it -- '' 
`` For your information , none of the rest of us Disapparated , '' 
`` You 've still got it ! '' 
`` Aguamenti ! '' 
`` I remembered this , '' 
`` Phineas Nigellus , '' 
`` Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him , '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes ? '' 
`` How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance ? '' 
`` But you never told us that ! '' 
`` There 's nothing in here about navy blue robes , nothing ! '' 
`` Tomorrow ? '' 
`` Try Finite Incantatem , '' 
`` that should stop the rain if it 's a hex or curse ; if it does n't , something 's gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm , which will be more difficult to fix , so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings -- '' 
`` Say it again , slowly -- '' 
`` Actually , Harry , I think I 'd better go after him , I do n't think he knows what he 's doing and if he gets caught the whole thing -- '' 
`` Level one , Minister of Magic and Support Staff . '' 
`` In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup , '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Hmm , '' 
`` If we lose it , if it gets stolen -- '' 
`` Oh , all right , all right , '' 
`` Fine , but we 'll go somewhere else to find it , '' 
`` It 's not stealing , is it ? '' 
`` Shut up now ! '' 
`` I did everything , '' 
`` Muffliato , Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment Charms , all of it . They should n't be able to hear or see us , whoever they are . '' 
`` Obscura ! '' 
`` I 'm very sorry , Professor Black , '' 
`` but it 's a necessary precaution ! '' 
`` Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity ! '' 
`` Hagrid 's not an oaf ! '' 
`` Professor Black , '' 
`` could n't you just tell us , please , when was the last time the sword was taken out of its case ? Before Ginny took it out , I mean ? '' 
`` I believe the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor Dumbledore used it to break open a ring . '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Think ! '' 
`` Somewhere in Hogsmeade ? '' 
`` It does n't mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it , Harry , '' 
`` Harry , what are you doing ? '' 
`` Why did you ask us to come with you , Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot ? '' 
'' Was there something you wanted to tell us ? '' 
`` All right , '' 
'' let 's go . '' 
`` You are Potter ? '' 
`` Yes , I am . '' 
`` Over here , '' 
`` There , '' 
'' Harry ? '' 
'' Confringo ! '' 
`` Harry , '' 
'' Do you feel all -- all right ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
'' I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk , I could n't lift you . You 've been ... Well , you have n't been quite ... '' 
`` You 've been ill , '' 
'' Quite ill . '' 
`` Not exactly , '' 
'' You 've been shouting and moaning and ... things , '' 
`` I could n't get the Horcrux off you , '' 
`` Yes , I -- I did . '' 
`` I 'm not truing to defend what Dumbledore wrote , '' 
`` Alone ? He was n't alone ! He had his brother and sister for company , his Squib sister he was keeping locked up -- '' 
`` I do n't believe it , '' 
`` He loved you , '' 
`` Thanks for the tea . I 'll finish the watch . You get back in the warm . '' 
`` We 'll go somewhere more sheltered , '' 
`` I 'm sure I imagined it , '' 
`` The Forest of Dean , '' 
`` You just need to practice , '' 
`` We need to talk , '' 
`` Er -- why ? '' 
`` It 's that mark , the mark in Beedle the Bard . Look at this ! '' 
`` The signature , '' 
`` It keeps cropping up , does n't it ? '' 
`` I 'm sure this is important ! '' 
`` Maybe ... maybe it 's something you need to find out for yourself , '' 
`` No , it does n't , '' 
`` but I still think we ought to talke to Xenophilius Lovegood . A symbol that links Dumbledore , Grindelwald , and Godric 's Hollow ? Harry , I 'm sure we ought to know about this ! '' 
`` Those in favor of going to see Lovegood -- '' 
`` I dunno exactly where , but Mum and Dad always point toward the hills whenever they mention the , . Should n't be hard to find . '' 
`` Well , it 's not like you have n't just seen them . You were there for Christmas , '' 
`` VBut where have you been , then ? '' 
`` Do you think it 's theirs , and they 've gone away for Christmas ? '' 
`` But what are the Deathly Hallows ? '' 
`` All right , '' 
`` Okay then , '' 
`` give me the Invisibility Cloak . Ron , you 're going to put it on . '' 
`` Hold tight , '' 
`` Obliviate ! '' 
`` Deprimo ! '' 
`` Oh I hope they do n't kill him ! '' 
`` That 's why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left , so they knew Xenophilius had n't been lying ! '' 
`` They 're in Australia , '' 
`` They should be all right . They do n't know anything . '' 
`` The Peverell coat of arms ? '' 
`` Yes ... and that 's all very interesting , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Not , it does n't , '' 
`` It does n't . Harry , you 're just getting carried away . Please , '' 
`` please just answer me this : If the Deathly Hallows really existed , and Dumbledore knew about them , knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death -- Harry , why would n't he have told you ? Why ? '' 
`` But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods ' ! '' 
`` Thank you , Ron , '' 
`` I 'll take first watch . '' 
`` Obsession ? '' 
`` I thought it was Voldemort we were supposed to be fighting ? '' 
`` We know ! '' 
`` Fred ! '' 
`` It 's so brave of them , '' 
`` No ! Leave him alone , leave him alone ! '' 
`` It is n't ! It is n't me ! '' 
`` But surely , '' 
`` this is the Mudblood girl ? This is Grander ? '' 
`` Are you sure ? Well then , the Dark Lord must be informed at once ! '' 
`` Your authority ! '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
'' Stupefy ! '' 
`` Where did you get this sword ? '' 
`` Where did you find this sword ? '' 
`` Snape sent it to my vault in Gringotts ! '' 
`` Release me , I say ! '' 
`` Be quiet ! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine , Cissy ! We have a very serious problem ! '' 
`` If it is indeed Potter , he must not be harmed , '' 
`` The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself ... But if he finds out ... I must ... I must know ... '' 
`` If she dies under questioning , I 'll take you next , '' 
`` Blood traitor is next to Mudblood in my book . Take them downstairs , Greyback , and make sure they are secure , but do nothing more to them -- yet . '' 
`` Oh yes , I expect so ... There 's an old nail we use if we need to break anything ... Just a moment ... '' 
`` Mr. Ollivander , have you got the nail ? If you just move over a little bit ... I think it was beside the water jug . '' 
`` You 'll need to stay still , '' 
`` We found it -- we found it -- PLEASE ! '' 
`` The cellar is completely escape-proof . I tried , at first . Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time , he 's tried everything . '' 
`` What else did you take , what else ? ANSWER ME ! CRUCIO ! '' 
`` We only met him tonight ! '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` And now , '' 
`` we 404 CHAPTER 23 . MALFOY MANOR call the Dark Lord ! '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys ' , Hermione . If they examine them properly , make them re-create the spells they 've cast lately , they 'd see that yours broke mine , they 'll see that you tried and failed to mend it , and they 'll realize that I 've been using the blackthorn one ever since . '' 
`` You -- you really think this wand exists , then , Mr. Ollivander ? '' 
`` So you -- you do n't think it can be a fairy tale or a myth ? '' 
`` You could never have done that , Harry , '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards , Ron . '' 
`` Ron , he 'd know the difference better than we would ! '' 
`` That , '' 
`` is despicable . Ask for his help , then double-cross him ? And you wonder why goblins do n't like wizards , Ron ? '' 
`` Does it make a difference ? '' 
`` Luna , we told you , '' 
`` I have my wand here , '' 
`` This is Dragomir Despard , '' 
`` I need to visit Gringotts , '' 
`` But you 've just done that ! '' 
`` Wait , wait ! '' 
`` Mr. Dumbledore '' 
`` I 'm so ... I 'm so sorry , '' 
`` I do n't believe it . Dumbledore loved Harry , '' 
`` I knew you 'd come ! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time ! '' 
`` It was Ron , all Ron 's idea ! '' 
`` He was amazing ! '' 
`` Amazing ! '' 
`` Who ? '' 
`` We 're all still here , '' 
`` we ; re still fighting . Come on , now ... '' 
`` Crookshanks ? '' 
`` Perfect ! '' 
`` The Cloak ! '' 
`` I think Harry 's right , '' 
`` No , I did n't , '' 
`` I had complete faith in you . '' 
`` He does n't mean it , '' 
`` Ron , for heaven 's sake , '' 
`` Honestly ! '' 
`` Harry , if you 're not going to watch at normal speed , you 're going to miss things ! '' 
`` Look at the referee ! '' 
`` The Irish Chasers were too good ... He wanted to end it on his terms , that 's all ... '' 
`` He was very brave , was n't he ? '' 
`` I is seeing no one , sir ... no one ... '' 
`` Amos , '' 
`` But she was frightened ! '' 
`` What 's going to happen to Winky ? '' 
`` The way they were treating her ! '' 
`` Running away when he 'd expressly told her not to ... embarrassing him in front of the whole Ministry ... how would that have looked , if she 'd been brought up in front of the Department for the Regulation and Control -- '' 
`` She did n't do anything -- she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time ! '' 
`` She did n't run amok ! '' 
`` I told you , it 's Voldemort 's symbol , Ron , '' 
`` So ... whoever conjured the Dark Mark ... '' 
`` were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters , or to scare them away ? '' 
`` Why were you asking if Hedwig had come , Harry ? '' 
`` But we do n't know where Sirius is ... he could be in Africa or somewhere , could n't he ? '' 
`` Come on -- three on three , Bill and Charlie and Fred and George will play ... You can try out the Wronski Feint ... '' 
`` Ron , '' 
`` Harry does n't want to play Quidditch right now ... He 's worried , and he 's tired ... We all need to go to bed ... '' 
`` Yeah , I want to play Quidditch , '' 
`` Hang on , I 'll get my Firebolt . '' 
`` Boys . '' 
`` If you ask me , Mr. Crouch is very lucky no one at the Daily Prophet knows how mean he is to elves ! '' 
`` His slave , you mean ! '' 
`` because he did n't pay Winky , did he ? '' 
`` Wreaked havoc and mayhem . Pots and pans everywhere . Place swimming in soup . Terrified the house-elves out of their wits -- '' 
`` There are house-elves here ? '' 
`` I 've never seen one ! '' 
`` They come out at night to do a bit of cleaning ... see to the fires and so on ... I mean , you 're not supposed to see them , are you ? That 's the mark of a good house-elf , is n't it , that you do n't know it 's there ? '' 
`` But they get paid ? '' 
`` House-elves do n't want sick leave and pensions ! '' 
`` Slave labor , '' 
`` That 's what made this dinner . Slave labor . '' 
`` Spotted dick , look ! Chocolate gateau ! '' 
`` Hmph ! '' 
`` What happened to him ? '' 
`` Just because they 're not very pretty , it does n't mean they 're not useful , '' 
`` They are now , '' 
`` but once Hagrid 's found out what they eat , I expect they 'll be six feet long . '' 
`` You know perfectly well I only said that to shut Malfoy up , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Hermione -- it 's the first day back ! We have n't even got homework yet ! '' 
`` See you at dinner ! '' 
`` ` I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... ' '' 
`` Lots of homework ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` He could have really hurt Malfoy , though , '' 
`` Got to , '' 
`` But you told us Professor Vector -- '' 
`` It 's not schoolwork , '' 
`` Avada Kedavra , '' 
`` For heaven 's sake , Ron , he 's only a Quidditch player , '' 
`` It 's not that cold , '' 
`` I bet Krum can see right through him , though ... bet he gets people fawning over him all the time ... Where d’you reckon they 're going to sleep ? We could offer him a space in our dormitory , Harry ... I would n't mind giving him my bed , I could kip on a camp bed . '' 
`` No one 's making you stay ! '' 
`` Bouillabaisse , '' 
`` It 's French , '' 
`` I had it on holiday summer before last . It 's very nice . '' 
`` Of course she is n't ! '' 
`` I do n't see anyone else gaping at her like an idiot ! '' 
`` When you 've both put your eyes back in , '' 
`` you 'll be able to see who 's just arrived . '' 
`` They organized the Triwizard Tournament , did n't they ? '' 
`` But I do n't think anyone under seventeen will stand a chance , '' 
`` we just have n't learned enough ... '' 
`` Speak for yourself , '' 
`` I 'm not sure this is going to work , you know , '' 
`` I 'm sure Dumbledore will have thought of this . '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` Well , I 'm glad someone from Gryffindor 's entering , '' 
`` I 've just realized -- I have n't asked Hagrid to join S.P.E.W. yet ! '' 
`` We 've been really busy , Hag -- '' 
`` Erm -- where are the skrewts ? '' 
`` Oh no , really ? '' 
`` But Harry set Dobby free , and he was over the moon about it ! '' 
`` Yeah , well , yeh get weirdos in every breed . I 'm not sayin ' there is n't the odd elf who 'd take freedom , but yeh 'll never persuade most of ’em ter do it -- no , nothin ' doin ' , Hermione . '' 
`` Is that aftershave ? '' 
`` Oh look , they 're all disappointed , '' 
`` Go on , '' 
`` Hello , '' 
`` Well , of course I knew you had n't entered yourself , '' 
`` Erm ... yes ... he was at breakfast , '' 
`` Well ... no , I do n't think so ... not really , '' 
`` Oh Harry , is n't it obvious ? '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` it 's always you who gets all the attention , you know it is . I know it 's not your fault , '' 
`` Really great . Tell him from me I 'll swap any time he wants . Tell him from me he 's welcome to it ... People gawping at my forehead everywhere I go ... '' 
`` I 'm not telling him anything , '' 
`` Maybe he 'll believe I 'm not enjoying myself once I 've got my neck broken or -- '' 
`` That 's not funny , '' 
`` That 's not funny at all . '' 
`` He came back to the country just because my scar twinged . He 'll probably come bursting right into the castle if I tell him someone 's entered me in the Triwizard Tournament -- '' 
`` He 'd want you to tell him , '' 
`` Harry , this is n't going to be kept quiet , '' 
`` Well , borrow one of the school owls , then , anyone can use them , '' 
`` It 's really not that difficult , Harry , '' 
`` Oh very funny , '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Er ... good luck on Tuesday , '' 
`` Ignore it , '' 
`` You miss him ! '' 
`` He 's not even good-looking ! '' 
`` Oh ... well ... '' 
`` Oh all right then ... '' 
`` but I hate talking to you in that cloak , I never know if I 'm looking at you or not . '' 
`` People keep looking at me now , '' 
`` She 's gone , '' 
`` Why do n't we go and have a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks , it 's a bit cold , is n't it ? You do n't have to talk to Ron ! '' 
`` I look like such an idiot , sitting here on my own , '' 
`` Lucky I brought something to do . '' 
`` You know , maybe I should try and get some of the villagers involved in S.P.E.W. , '' 
`` When house-elves have decent wages and working conditions ! '' 
`` Hello , '' 
`` Does he ? '' 
`` I wonder what he 's up to ? I do n't know whether you should go , Harry ... '' 
`` It might make you late for Sirius . '' 
`` I think this is the best thing that could have happened to those elves , you know , '' 
`` Oh she 'll cheer up , '' 
`` Probably says he 's not a very good Head of Department , '' 
`` and let 's face it ... he 's got a point , has n't he ? '' 
`` Do n't let Percy hear you saying that , '' 
`` Imagine what I 'd look like trying to dance with her . '' 
`` Mmm ... you 're not exactly straining yourself , though , are you ? '' 
`` That egg ! '' 
`` But it might take weeks to work it out ! '' 
`` We should get a move on , you know ... ask someone . He 's right . We do n't want to end up with a pair of trolls . '' 
`` Oh I see , '' 
`` I 'm going to bed , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` Oh Harry , I 'm really sorry , '' 
`` I 'm really sorry , '' 
`` Oh -- Cedric , '' 
`` Do n't laugh -- '' 
`` Why were n't you two at dinner ? '' 
`` All the good-looking ones taken , Ron ? '' 
`` Hermione , Neville 's right -- you are a girl ... '' 
`` Oh well spotted , '' 
`` No , I ca n't , '' 
`` because I 'm already going with someone . '' 
`` Oh did I ? '' 
`` I 've already told you ! '' 
`` I 'm going with someone else ! '' 
`` Oooh there 's a tragedy , '' 
`` I 'm not telling you , you 'll just make fun of me . '' 
`` Twitchy little ferret , are n't you , Malfoy ? '' 
`` your teeth ... '' 
`` What about them ? '' 
`` No , I mean , they 're different to how they were before he put that hex on you ... They 're all ... straight and -- and normalsized . '' 
`` Well ... when I went up to Madam Pomfrey to get them shrunk , she held up a mirror and told me to stop her when they were back to how they normally were , '' 
`` And I just ... let her carry on a bit . '' 
`` ` Constant vigilance ! ' You 'd think I walk around with my eyes shut , banging off the walls ... '' 
`` But he 's right , Harry , '' 
`` you have still got two tasks to do . You really ought to have a look at that egg , you know , and start working out what it means ... '' 
`` Oh I suppose not , '' 
`` Hi , Harry ! '' 
`` Her-my-oh-nee , '' 
`` Close enough , '' 
`` It 's hot , is n't it ? '' 
`` Has n't he asked you to call him Vicky yet ? '' 
`` What 's up with you ? '' 
`` fraternizing with the enemy , that 's what you 're doing ! '' 
`` Do n't be so stupid ! '' 
`` Yes , he did , '' 
`` No , I was n't ! If you really want to know , he -- he said he 'd been coming up to the library every day to try and talk to me , but he had n't been able to pluck up the courage ! '' 
`` Obvious , is n't it ? He 's Karkaroff 's student , is n't he ? He knows who you hang around with ... He 's just trying to get closer to Harry -- get inside information on him -- or get near enough to jinx him -- '' 
`` I 'd never help him work out that egg ! '' 
`` This whole tournament 's supposed to be about getting to know foreign wizards and making friends with them ! '' 
`` Do n't call him Vicky ! '' 
`` What 's he avoiding us for ? '' 
`` I just thought you 'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet , '' 
`` Have you really ? '' 
`` It 's a lot colder where he comes from , '' 
`` He 's really nice , you know , '' 
`` Does n't he ever go into the office ? '' 
`` Look ! '' 
`` He should n't be doing that ! '' 
`` Well , I do n't think Dumbledore would like it if he knew Bagman was trying to persuade you to cheat ! '' 
`` Those goblins did n't look very friendly , '' 
`` Probably thinks if Crouch snuffs it he 'll be made head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation . '' 
`` Ha , ha , ha , '' 
`` Well , they 're quite capable of dealing with wizards , '' 
`` You horrible woman , '' 
`` you do n't care , do you , anything for a story , and anyone will do , wo n't they ? Even Ludo Bagman -- '' 
`` I know things about Ludo Bagman that would make your hair curl ... not that it needs it -- '' 
`` Let 's go , '' 
`` c 'm on , Harry -- Ron ... '' 
`` Let her try ! '' 
`` My parents do n't read the Daily Prophet . She ca n't scare me into hiding ! '' 
`` And Hagrid is n't hiding anymore ! He should never have let that excuse for a human being upset him ! Come on ! '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Hagrid , that 's enough ! We know you 're in there ! Nobody cares if your mum was a giantess , Hagrid ! You ca n't let that foul Skeeter woman do this to you ! Hagrid , get out here , you 're just being -- '' 
`` About t -- ! '' 
`` We -- er -- we wanted to see Hagrid , '' 
`` Oh ... um ... okay , '' 
`` Hermione , Harry , and Ron still seem to want to know you , judging by the way they were attempting to break down the door . '' 
`` My own brother , Aberforth , was prosecuted for practicing inappropriate charms on a goat . It was all over the papers , but did Aberforth hide ? No , he did not ! He held his head high and went about his business as usual ! Of course , I 'm not entirely sure he can read , so that may not have been bravery ... '' 
`` Come back and teach , Hagrid , '' 
`` please come back , we really miss you . '' 
`` Oh Ron , '' 
`` we thought Snape was trying to kill Harry before , and it turned out he was saving Harry 's life , remember ? '' 
`` I do n't care what Moody says , '' 
`` Why has Mr. Crouch been pretending to be ill ? '' 
`` You just want to think Snape 's up to something , '' 
`` Of course , the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure yourself into a submarine or something , '' 
`` I s ' pose I could always attack someone in front of Moody ; he might do it for me ... '' 
`` I do n't think he 'd let you choose what you wanted to be turned into , though , '' 
`` Weekend after next , '' 
`` What were you going to do , snore at them ? '' 
`` It looks like it , does n't it ? '' 
`` There they are , there they are ! '' 
`` I told you not to annoy Rita Skeeter ! She 's made you out to be some sort of -- of scarlet woman ! '' 
`` Scarlet woman ? '' 
`` If that 's the best Rita can do , she 's losing her touch , '' 
`` What a pile of old rubbish . '' 
`` There 's something funny , though , '' 
`` Do n't be stupid , '' 
`` No , it 's just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer ? '' 
`` He asked me right after he 'd pulled me out of the lake , '' 
`` And he did say he 'd never felt the same way about anyone else , '' 
`` but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him ? She was n't there ... or was she ? Maybe she has got an Invisibility Cloak ; maybe she sneaked onto the grounds to watch the second task ... '' 
`` Crouch 's son was caught ? '' 
`` Did Crouch try and get his son off ? '' 
`` It 's half past three , '' 
`` Percy would never throw any of his family to the dementors , '' 
`` You 've just had breakfast ! '' 
`` Dobby , where 's Winky ? '' 
`` Oh dear , '' 
`` you do n't know what Mr. Crouch might be up to , do you ? Because he 's stopped turning up to judge the Triwizard Tournament . '' 
`` M -- Master is stopped -- hic -- coming ? '' 
`` But we 're not sure if that 's true , '' 
`` Master can not -- hic -- manage -- hic -- all by himself ... '' 
`` Other people manage to do their own housework , you know , Winky , '' 
`` Winky keeps -- hic -- her master 's secrets , '' 
'' Hagrid was in such a bad mood , Harry was quite glad to say good-bye to him in front of the Fat Lady . He clambered through the portrait hole into the common room and hurried straight for the corner where Ron and Hermione were sitting , to tell them what had happened . C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - N I N E ` 564 ` THE DREAM t comes down to this , '' 
`` You ca n't Disapparate on the Hogwarts grounds , have n't I told you enough times ? '' 
`` And Mr. Crouch evaporated , did he ? '' 
`` Just go through it again , Harry , '' 
`` Well , that was his fault , '' 
`` We need to see Professor Moody , '' 
`` What , at this time ? '' 
`` You do n't think they know something about all this , do you ? '' 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
`` I thought they were only saying it to annoy Mum , but they really mean it , they want to start one . They 've only got a year left at Hogwarts , they keep going on about how it 's time to think about their future , and Dad ca n't help them , and they need gold to get started . '' 
`` Yes , but this is the law , '' 
`` D’you think it 's too early to go and see Professor Moody ? '' 
`` You ca n't Disapparate on the grounds , Ron ! '' 
`` Mind works the right way , Granger . '' 
`` But under his own steam ? '' 
`` or because someone made him ? '' 
`` you stick close to Potter , all right ? I 'm keeping an eye on things , but all the same ... you can never have too many eyes out . '' 
`` Ha ! She has n't got wind of Crouch ! '' 
`` He 's worried about you ! '' 
`` No one 's done anything to me at all -- '' 
`` Except put your name in the Goblet of Fire , '' 
`` They could n't have made it look like an accident if they 'd murdered you in the forest ! '' 
`` Harry , I do n't understand it either , '' 
`` Well , I think Harry 's got it now , anyway , '' 
`` And we do n't have to worry about Disarming , because he 's been able to do that for ages ... I think we ought to start on some of these hexes this evening . '' 
`` I like the look of this one , '' 
`` this Impediment Curse . Should slow down anything that 's trying to attack you , Harry . We 'll start with that one . '' 
`` See you at dinner ! '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` Oh ... yes ... all right , '' 
`` Oh , Rita has n't written anything at all since the third task , '' 
`` As a matter of fact , '' 
`` Rita Skeeter is n't going to be writing anything at all for a while . Not unless she wants me to spill the beans on her . '' 
`` I found out how she was listening in on private conversations when she was n't supposed to be coming onto the grounds , '' 
`` Well , it was you , really , who gave me the idea , Harry , '' 
`` Bugging , '' 
`` But you said they did n't work -- '' 
`` Oh not electronic bugs , '' 
`` No , you see ... Rita Skeeter '' 
`` is an unregistered Animagus . She can turn -- '' 
`` You have n't ... she 's not ... '' 
`` Oh yes she is , '' 
`` No , I 'm not , '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` He was talking to her , in his hand , '' 
`` He knew , of course . That 's how she 's been getting all those nice little interviews with the Slytherins . They would n't care that she was doing something illegal , as long as they were giving her horrible stuff about us and Hagrid . '' 
`` I 've told her I 'll let her out when we get back to London , '' 
`` I 've put an Unbreakable Charm on the jar , you see , so she ca n't transform . And I 've told her she 's to keep her quill to herself for a whole year . See if she ca n't break the habit of writing horrible lies about people . '' 
`` But -- it must 've been an accident , must n't it ? '' 
`` He did n't refuse ! '' 
`` ' Bye , Harry ! '' 
`` they did n't talk to me much , but I like it better that way . How 're you , Hermione ? '' 
`` Oh , I 'm fine , '' 
`` We thought -- '' 
`` Something wrong , Hermione ? '' 
`` What 's she done now ? '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Not you as well ! '' 
`` That 's not fair , '' 
`` Sirius was in Azkaban half her life and before that their families never met -- '' 
`` That 's not the point , '' 
`` It 's survivor 's guilt , '' 
`` She ca n't change her appearance like she used to , '' 
`` Nor did I , '' 
`` but I suppose if you 're really depressed ... '' 
`` What 's this ? '' 
`` But he knows your dad was right all along now about Voldemort being back -- '' 
`` Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right , '' 
`` Nobody knows what it said , though , '' 
`` Shh ! '' 
`` I squeezed it and it -- it punched me ! '' 
`` Harry , oh , Harry ... '' 
`` We wondered , after we got back from the Ministry ... Obviously , we did n't want to say anything to you , but from what Lucius said about the prophecy , how it was about you and Voldemort , well , we thought it might be something like this ... Oh , Harry ... '' 
`` That 's true , '' 
`` ... and evasive enchantments generally , '' 
`` Today ? '' 
`` Today ? But why did n't you -- oh my God -- you should have said -- '' 
`` Yes , I can hardly breathe for laughing , '' 
`` But it 's barely nine , there 's still plenty of time ... '' 
`` I know I messed up Ancient Runes , '' 
`` I definitely made at least one serious mistranslation . And the Defense Against the Dark Arts practical was no good at all . I thought Transfiguration went all right at the time , but looking back -- '' 
`` Do n't , do n't , do n't ! '' 
`` One for each of us , '' 
`` Oh no ... oh no ... oh no ... '' 
`` Oh no ! '' 
`` I -- not bad , '' 
`` You 're actually disappointed , are n't you ? '' 
`` That gives you equal status with prefects ! '' 
`` No , do n't , honestly , it 's not worth it ... '' 
`` Yeah , like you 'd dare do magic out of school , '' 
`` Harry , no ! '' 
`` now I know the kind of scum that shops here ... We 'll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting 's . '' 
`` ` Patented Daydream Charms ... ' '' 
`` ` One simple incantation and you will enter a top-quality , highly realistic , thirty-minute daydream , easy to fit into the average school lesson and virtually undetectable -LRB- side effects include vacant expression and minor drooling -RRB- . Not for sale to under-sixteens . ' You know , '' 
`` Your punching telescope , '' 
`` Why , though ? '' 
`` Oh -- I do n't know , Harry , '' 
`` C’mon . '' 
`` That 's him , is n't it ? '' 
`` Our feet 'll be seen ! '' 
`` Shh ! Look ! He 's in there ! '' 
`` If only we could hear what they 're saying ! '' 
`` Fantastic ! '' 
`` No , he was behind that cabinet -- '' 
`` You two stay here , '' 
`` What are you -- ? '' 
`` Hello , horrible morning , is n't it ? '' 
`` Is this necklace for sale ? '' 
`` Oh -- er -- no , I have n't got quite that much , '' 
`` Get out ! '' 
`` Worth a try , but you were a bit obvious -- '' 
`` Well , next time you can show me how it 's done , Master of Mystery ! '' 
`` Yes , I 've already agreed it was fishy , Harry , '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` It seems very unlikely , Harry , '' 
`` I think he just wanted to get out of there , Harry , '' 
`` We ca n't , Harry , '' 
`` that you know what Felix Felicis does , Miss Granger ? '' 
`` It 's liquid luck , '' 
`` Can I borrow your silver knife ? '' 
`` How are you doing that ? '' 
`` Add a clockwise stir -- '' 
`` No , no , the book says counterclockwise ! '' 
`` Well , it was n't exactly your own work , was it ? '' 
`` I just tried a few of the tips written in the margins , honestly , Ginny , there 's nothing funny -- '' 
`` Ginny 's got a point , '' 
`` Specialis Revelio ! '' 
`` It seems all right , '' 
`` official '' 
`` Or herself , '' 
`` How many girls have been Princes ? '' 
`` Ooooh ! '' 
`` Two of spades : conflict , '' 
`` Seven of spades : an ill omen . Ten of spades : violence . Knave of spades : a dark young man , possibly troubled , one who dislikes the questioner -- '' 
`` Well , that ca n't be right , '' 
`` Good night , sir . '' 
`` We 've got to go and explain , '' 
`` We did n't hate it ! '' 
`` I hate not talking to Hagrid , '' 
`` Oh , come on , Harry , '' 
`` And it does n't hurt that you 've grown about a foot over the summer either , '' 
`` Oh good , '' 
`` I 'll give Slughorn back the new one , he ca n't complain , it cost nine Galleons . '' 
`` Anyone we know dead ? '' 
`` No , but there have been more dementor attacks , '' 
`` Stan Shunpike , '' 
`` It does n't look like it , '' 
`` It says here he was arrested after he was overheard talking about the Death Eaters ' secret plans in a pub . '' 
`` They probably want to look as though they 're doing something , '' 
`` I do n't think we 've got him all the time , '' 
`` I think he 's left the school to do something with the Order , '' 
`` I think it 's fascinating , '' 
`` Oh , it was quite fun , really , '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` should 've used Muffliato , Harry . '' 
`` No , we should n't ! '' 
`` Well , come on ... we 'd better get going ... '' 
`` Pass me a bowl , '' 
`` Anyway , '' 
`` Slughorn 's going to have a Christmas party , Harry , and there 's no way you 'll be able to wriggle out of this one because he actually asked me to check your free evenings , so he could be sure to have it on a night you can come . '' 
`` Just for the Slug Club , yes , '' 
`` Look , I did n't make up the name ` Slug Club ' -- '' 
`` ` Slug Club , ' '' 
`` It 's pathetic . Well , I hope you enjoy your party . Why do n't you try hooking up with McLaggen , then Slughorn can make you King and Queen Slug -- '' 
`` We 're allowed to bring guests , '' 
`` and I was going to ask you to come , but if you think it 's that stupid then I wo n't bother ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Hand that over , Harry , '' 
`` Ron , I warn you , do n't drink it ! '' 
`` You should be expelled for that . I 'd never have believed it of you , Harry ! '' 
`` Confunded anyone lately ? '' 
`` I want a word with you , Harry . '' 
`` You go ! '' 
`` I 'm sick of Ron at the moment , I do n't know what I 'm supposed to have done ... '' 
`` Do n't pretend you did n't see him , '' 
`` Oops ! '' 
`` Hi , Harry ! Wondered where you 'd got to ! '' 
`` You should n't leave Lavender waiting outside , '' 
`` She 'll wonder where you 've gone . '' 
`` He 's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes , '' 
`` I really could n't care less . '' 
`` And incidentally , '' 
`` you need to be careful . '' 
`` They did n't have the potions with them in the bathroom , '' 
`` They were just discussing tactics . As I doubt whether even the Half-Blood Prince '' 
`` could dream up an antidote for a dozen different love potions at once , I 'd just invite someone to go with you , that 'll stop all the others thinking they 've still got a chance . It 's tomorrow night , they 're getting desperate . '' 
`` Well , just be careful what you drink , because Romilda Vane looked like she meant business , '' 
`` And when has anyone ever paid attention to what Filch has banned ? '' 
`` Fred and George send them disguised as perfumes and cough potions , '' 
`` You know a lot about it . '' 
`` It was all on the back of the bottles they showed Ginny and me in the summer , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` Secrecy Sensors detect jinxes , curses , and concealment charms , do n't they ? They 're used to find Dark Magic and Dark objects . They 'd have picked up a powerful curse , like the one on that necklace , within seconds . But something that 's just been put in the wrong bottle would n't register -- and anyway , love potions are n't Dark or dangerous -- '' 
`` -- so it would be down to Filch to realize it was n't a cough potion , and he 's not a very good wizard , I doubt he can tell one potion from -- '' 
`` The library is now closed , '' 
`` Despoiled ! '' 
`` Fancy a gillywater ? '' 
`` Told you , '' 
`` Sooner you ask someone , sooner they 'll all leave you alone and you can -- '' 
`` Well , good night , Harry , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` Thank you , Harry . Well , I 'd better get going ... '' 
`` Hi , Parvati ! '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` The one who almost '' 
`` became Gryffindor Keeper . '' 
`` Oh -- yes -- did n't you know ? '' 
`` Wow , you like your Quidditch players , do n't you ? First Krum , then McLaggen ... '' 
`` I like really good Quidditch players , '' 
`` Well , see you ... Got to go and get ready for the party ... '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` Oh , I 've just escaped -- I mean , I 've just left Cormac , '' 
`` Under the mistletoe , '' 
`` I thought he 'd annoy Ron most , '' 
`` Let 's get something straight . Are you planning to tell Ron that you interfered at Keeper tryouts ? '' 
`` Hermione , if you can ask out McLaggen -- '' 
`` There 's a difference , '' 
`` Quidditch ! '' 
`` Is that all boys care about ? Cormac has n't asked me one single question about myself , no , I 've just been treated to ` A Hundred Great Saves Made by Cormac McLaggen ' nonstop ever since -- oh no , here he comes ! '' 
`` My dear boy ! '' 
`` Harry , where are you going ? '' 
`` Then the poisoner did n't know Slughorn very well , '' 
`` Well , I do n't think it 's Quidditch , but I think there 's a connection between the attacks , '' 
`` Well , for one thing , they both ought to have been fatal and were n't , although that was pure luck . And for another , neither the poison nor the necklace seems to have reached the person who was supposed to be killed . Of course , '' 
`` that makes the person behind this even more dangerous in a way , because they do n't seem to care how many people they finish off before they actually reach their victim . '' 
`` Has n't he got any ideas , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Surely not ? '' 
`` Look out , '' 
`` It 's all right ! '' 
`` Here ... '' 
`` Reparo . '' 
`` Oh , Dean was laughing about McLaggen hitting that Bludger at you , '' 
`` It did n't look funny at all ! '' 
`` Yes , they are -- but why are you so interested ? '' 
`` But they said you 'd left ... '' 
`` You 're making fun of me , are n't you ? '' 
`` Oh , it 's a Gurdyroot , '' 
`` You can keep it if you like , I 've got a few of them . They 're really excellent for warding off Gulping Plimpies . '' 
`` Why did n't you tell me you were getting out today ? And why was she with you ? '' 
`` Listen , I 've got to hurry or I 'll be late for Dumbledore ... '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
`` If you will not banish the usurping nag , so be it ... LORD VOLDEMORT 'S REQUEST ` 427 ` Perhaps I shall find a school where my talents are better appreciated ... '' 
`` You wo n't find anything in there , '' 
`` He would if you 'd just listened to Snape in our first year , '' 
`` For H CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE ` 448 ` Enemies , '' 
`` I 'm telling you , the stupid Prince is n't going to be able to help you with this , Harry ! '' 
`` That 's why I 'm looking for something different . Dumbledore says Veritaserum wo n't do it , but there might be something else , a potion or a spell ... '' 
`` You 're going about it the wrong way , '' 
`` It ca n't be B -- U -- M -- '' 
`` No , it is n't , '' 
`` It 's one of Fred and George 's Spell-Check ones ... but I think the charm must be wearing off ... '' 
`` Yes , it must , '' 
`` because we were asked how we 'd deal with dementors , not ` Dugbogs , ' and I do n't remember you changing your name to ` Roonil Wazlib ' either . '' 
`` It 's okay , we can fix it , '' 
`` Do n't let Lavender hear you saying that . '' 
`` There , '' 
`` What is this ? '' 
`` I think it 'll be part of the magic of the room , '' 
`` But I do n't think you will , Harry , '' 
`` Kreacher 's done well too , '' 
`` But what 's all this about him going up there with a ` variety of students ' ? '' 
`` Do you mean to say , '' 
`` that that little girl whose scales I repaired -- ? '' 
`` Hmmm ... the Dark Mark we do n't know exists , '' 
`` Yes , we will , '' 
`` But , Harry , before you get all excited , I still do n't think you 'll be able to get into the Room of Requirement without knowing what 's there first . And I do n't think you should forget '' 
`` I 've already told you , you need to persuade Slughorn , '' 
`` It 's not a question of tricking him or bewitching him , or Dumbledore could have done it in a second . Instead of messing around outside the Room of Requirement '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` But it 's all right , he 's not dead -- it 's Mundungus , he 's been arrested and sent to Azkaban ! Something to do with impersonating an Inferius during an attempted burglary ... and someone called Octavius Pepper has vanished ... Oh , and how horrible , a nine-year-old boy has been arrested for trying to kill his grandparents , they think he was under the Imperius Curse ... '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` You 'd do better , '' 
`` Hello ... you 're very pretty , are n't you ? '' 
`` And what about you ? '' 
`` It 's a bit odd , '' 
`` You do n't think she can have been ... you know ... in love with Sirius ? '' 
`` It 's a thought , '' 
`` And yet , '' 
`` I doubt you 'd find a woman who sulked for half an hour because Madam Rosmerta did n't laugh at their joke about the hag , the Healer , and the Mimbulus mimbletonia . '' 
`` For the last time , just forget about Malfoy , '' 
`` It is n't Lavender , '' 
`` Maybe he wants to check on how you 're doing ? '' 
`` Oh , for heaven 's sake , '' 
`` It 's not just that , '' 
`` Yes , but for something like this ? '' 
`` Harry , you ca n't be thinking of going , '' 
`` Yes , he will , '' 
`` Ron , that 's -- that 's it ! '' 
`` What on earth is more important than this memory , Harry ? '' 
`` That 's decided , then , '' 
`` Destination ... determination ... deliberation ... '' 
`` I feel sick enough as it is -- quick , hide me ! '' 
`` It is n't Lavender ! '' 
`` They 're the Montgomery sisters and of course they do n't look happy , did n't you hear what happened to their little brother ? '' 
`` Well , the rumor is that it was that Fenrir Greyback , '' 
`` Harry , you 've got to get that memory , '' 
`` It 's all about stopping Voldemort , is n't it ? These dreadful things that are happening are all down to him ... '' 
`` And you too ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` He -- he just failed , '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` it does seem really harsh ... '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` What does it feel like ? '' 
`` No , Harry -- you 've got to go and see Slughorn , remember ? '' 
`` This is Felix Felicis , I suppose ? '' 
`` What does he want ? '' 
`` Harry , are you okay ? '' 
`` Harry -- '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` I was there , I saw it . We arrived back on the Astronomy Tower because that 's where the Mark was ... Dumbledore was ill , he was weak , but I think he realized it was a trap when we heard footsteps running up the stairs . He immobilized me , I could n't do anything , I was under the Invisibility Cloak -- and then Malfoy came through the door and disarmed him -- '' 
`` were you -- ? '' 
`` Outside Snape 's office , yes , '' 
`` with Luna . We hung around for ages outside it and nothing happened ... We did n't know what was going on upstairs , Ron had taken the map ... It was nearly midnight when Professor Flitwick came sprinting down into the dungeons . He was shouting about Death Eaters in the castle , I do n't think he really registered that Luna and I were there at all , he just burst his way into Snape 's office and we heard him saying that Snape had to go back with him and help and then we heard a loud thump and Snape came hurtling out of his room and he saw us and -- and -- '' 
`` I was so stupid , Harry ! '' 
`` He said Professor Flitwick had collapsed and that we should go and take care of him while he -- while he went to help fight the Death Eaters -- '' 
`` I expect we 'll be seeing you quite soon '' 
`` I know this must be frustrating for you ... '' 
`` Keep your nose clean and everything will be okay ... '' 
`` Be careful and do n't do anything rash ... '' 
`` He seemed to think it was best , '' 
`` He was so angry , '' 
`` Are n't you ... are n't you worried about the Ministry of Magic hearing ? '' 
`` You 're not telling me he does n't know ways to send messages without owls . '' 
`` Of course he does n't think that ! '' 
`` Harry , we wanted to tell you , we really did -- '' 
`` Harry , we 're really sorry ! '' 
`` It 's a secret society , '' 
`` We 've told you , the Order do n't let us in on their meetings , '' 
`` So we do n't know the details -- but we 've got a general idea -- '' 
`` Ears , yeah . Only we 've had to stop using them lately because Mum found out and went berserk . Fred and George had to hide them all to stop Mum binning them . But we got a good bit of use out of them before Mum realized what was going on . We know some of the Order are following known Death Eaters , keeping tabs on them , you know -- '' 
`` -- some of them are working on recruiting more people to the Order -- '' 
`` We have , '' 
`` Stop doing that ! '' 
`` He 's on our side now , '' 
`` Percy takes the Daily Prophet seriously , '' 
`` Have n't -- have n't you been getting the Daily Prophet ? '' 
`` Have you -- er -- been reading it thoroughly ? '' 
`` Well , you 'd need to read it cover to cover to pick it up , but they -- um -- they mention you a couple of times a week . '' 
`` But I 'd have seen -- '' 
`` Not if you 've only been reading the front page , you would n't , '' 
`` It 's quite nasty , actually , '' 
`` Oh no , she 's kept her promise -- not that she 's got any choice , '' 
`` Well , they 're writing about you as though you 're this deluded , attention-seeking person who thinks he 's a great tragic hero or something , '' 
`` I know you do n't , '' 
`` And of course , they did n't report a word about the dementors attacking you , '' 
`` Someone 's told them to keep that quiet . That should 've been a really big story , out-of-control dementors . They have n't even reported that you broke the International Statute of Secrecy -- we thought they would , it would tie in so well with this image of you as some stupid show-off -- we think they 're NUMBER TWELVE , GRIMMAULD PLACE ` 75 ` biding their time until you 're expelled , then they 're really going to go to town -- I mean , if you 're expelled , obviously , '' 
`` you really should n't be , not if they abide by their own laws , there 's no case against you . '' 
`` We knew you 'd be angry , Harry , we really do n't blame you , but you 've got to understand , we did try and persuade Dumbledore -- '' 
`` Yeah , I know , '' 
`` Nutter . Never met one like him . '' 
`` It 's not ` spew ' ! '' 
`` And do n't forget to keep your voice down in the hall , Harry , '' 
`` Now -- as I was saying , Quidditch tryouts will be held ... '' 
`` Yes , it certainly was illuminating , '' 
`` I said illuminating , not enjoyable , '' 
`` There was some important stuff hidden in the waffle , '' 
`` I 'll tell you what it means , '' 
`` Well , they are , they 're titchy ... '' 
`` I know , but you ca n't call them midgets ... First years ! '' 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
`` You look absolutely -- oh for heaven 's sake . '' 
`` Because we 're prefects ! '' 
`` Anyway , what 's up , Harry ? '' 
`` Yes , Lavender thinks so too , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I told her to keep her big fat mouth PROFESSOR UMBRIDGE ` 223 ` shut about you , actually . And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron 's and my throats , Harry , because if you have n't noticed , we 're on your side . '' 
`` That 's quite all right , '' 
`` I listen , Ron , '' 
`` So do I , but I still could n't tell you exactly what -- '' 
`` The point , '' 
`` is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about . Voldemort 's only been back two months , and we 've started fighting among ourselves . And the Sorting Hat 's warning was the same -- stand together , be united -- '' 
`` Well , I think it 's a pity we 're not trying for a bit of inter-House unity , '' 
`` Maybe ... '' 
`` I 'd forgotten Wood had left , '' 
`` It 's best to know what the enemy are saying , '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` And speaking of your Skiving Snackboxes , '' 
`` Says me , '' 
`` And why would starting fifth year mean I want a Skiving Snackbox ? '' 
`` But where are you going to get the gold to start a joke shop ? '' 
`` What did that mean ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Yes , it is , but it 's not the only worthwhile thing , '' 
`` How would it be , '' 
`` If you want that on your conscience , Hermione ... '' 
`` Well , you 'd deserve it , '' 
`` Oh , do n't give me that rubbish , '' 
`` Oh , it was all right , you know ... '' 
`` Is that a Tornados badge ? '' 
`` Anyway ... see you , Harry . '' 
`` Not about the chapter , no , '' 
`` I 've got a query about your course aims , '' 
`` Hermione Granger , '' 
`` Well , I do n't , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` No we have n't , '' 
`` we just -- '' 
`` Your hand is not up , Miss Granger ! '' 
`` Harry , no ! '' 
`` Oh , let 's get out of here . '' 
`` Look , you do n't understand what it was like after it happened , '' 
`` I know it is , Harry , so will you please stop biting my head off ? '' 
`` Mimbulus mimbletonia , '' 
`` How can Dumbledore have let this happen ? '' 
`` Of course she 's here to spy on us all , that 's obvious , why else would Fudge have wanted her to come ? '' 
`` So what are the properties of moonstone and its uses in potionmaking ? '' 
`` That 's enough ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` but I will write to your mother . '' 
`` Oh , yes , I would , '' 
`` Thank you for your support , Ron , '' 
`` Oh , it 's no good , I ca n't concentrate now . I 'm going to bed . '' 
`` They 're hats for house-elves , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Of course they want to be free ! '' 
`` Do n't you dare touch those hats , Ron ! '' 
`` The hats have gone . Seems the house-elves do want freedom after all . '' 
`` They might not count as clothes . They did n't look anything like hats to me , more like woolly bladders . '' 
`` Bowtruckles , '' 
`` Wood lice , '' 
`` Dumbledore would know if something had happened to Hagrid , '' 
`` I was n't going to , '' 
`` Well , they were right , were n't they ? '' 
`` Oh , for heaven 's sake , Harry , you can do better than her , '' 
`` What 's that got to do with our homework ? '' 
`` At least it 's only lines , '' 
`` Well , why did n't you do any last night ? '' 
`` Oh , Harry , it 's you ... Good about Ron , is n't it ? '' 
`` I 'm just so -- so -- so tired , '' 
`` Listen , Hermione , I was just up in Umbridge 's office and she touched my arm ... '' 
`` You 're worried that Voldemort 's controlling her like he controlled Quirrell ? '' 
`` I suppose so , '' 
`` But last year your scar hurt when nobody was touching you , and did n't Dumbledore say it had to do with what Voldemort was feeling at the time ? I mean , maybe this has n't got anything to do with Umbridge at all , maybe it 's just coincidence it happened while you were with her ? '' 
`` Harry , you ca n't put something like that in a letter ! '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` if you 're going that means I can go without being rude too , I 'm absolutely exhausted and I want to make some more hats tomorrow . Listen , you can help me if you like , it 's quite fun , I 'm getting better , I can do patterns and bobbles and all sorts of things now . '' 
`` Look , I do n't think you should , '' 
`` you 're both really behind on homework as it -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` just some guff about the bass player in the Weird Sisters getting married ... '' 
`` Wait a moment , '' 
`` ` The Ministry of Magic has received a tip-off from a reliable source that Sirius Black , notorious mass murderer ... blah blah blah ... is currently hiding in London ! ' '' 
`` ... ` Ministry warns Wizarding community that Black is very dangerous ... killed thirteen people ... broke out of Azkaban ... ' the usual rubbish , '' 
`` Well , he just wo n't be able to leave the house again , that 's all , '' 
`` Ron , shh ! '' 
`` Do n't be silly , it was n't just for trying to get through a door -- what on earth was he doing at the Ministry of Magic at one o’clock in the morning ? '' 
`` Well , maybe they did n't expect him to get caught , '' 
`` Do you know , I would n't be at all surprised if that were true . '' 
`` How was practice ? '' 
`` No one , '' 
`` I thought -- '' 
`` You thought I was bound to be rubbish ? '' 
`` Jupiter 's biggest moon is Ganymede , not Callisto , '' 
`` Sorry , I only -- '' 
`` Yeah , well , if you 've just come over here to criticize -- '' 
`` Ron -- '' 
`` I have n't got time to listen to a sermon , all right , Hermione , I 'm up to my neck in it here -- '' 
`` No -- look ! '' 
`` Is n't that Hermes ? '' 
`` Open it ! '' 
`` Oh , give them here , '' 
`` Give them to me , I 'll look through them and correct them , '' 
`` What you can say is , ` We promise we 'll never leave our homework this late again , ' '' 
`` But what if you 'd been seen ? '' 
`` But Sirius , this is taking an awful risk -- '' 
`` You did n't say you 'd written to Sirius ! '' 
`` We 'll tell you afterward , go on , Sirius . '' 
`` What 's she got against werewolves ? '' 
`` Sirius ! '' 
`` So we 're being prevented from learning Defense Against the Dark Arts because Fudge is scared we 'll use spells against the Ministry ? '' 
`` But if he was supposed to be back by now ... '' 
`` Sirius , did n't you see the Daily Prophet ? '' 
`` What does that mean ? '' 
`` ` Hogwarts is a school , not an outpost of Cornelius Fudge 's office , ' said Madam Marchbanks . ` This is a further disgusting attempt to discredit Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore . ' -LRB- For a full account of Madam Marchbanks ' alleged links to subversive goblin groups , turn to page 17 -RRB- . '' 
`` So now we know how we ended up with Umbridge ! Fudge passed this ` Educational Decree ' and forced her on us ! And now he 's given her the power to inspect other teachers ! '' 
`` Well , come on , '' 
`` we 'd better get going , if she 's inspecting Binns 's class we do n't want to be late ... '' 
`` Well , that was n't as bad as last week , was it ? '' 
`` I mean , all right , I did n't expect the top grade , not if he 's marking to O.W.L. standard , but a pass is quite encouraging at this stage , would n't you say ? '' 
`` Nothing wrong with a good healthy P. '' 
`` But , '' 
`` does n't P stand for ... '' 
`` ` Poor , ' yeah , '' 
`` So top grade 's O for ` Outstanding , ' '' 
`` and then there 's A -- '' 
`` No , E , '' 
`` E for ` Exceeds Expectations . ' And I 've always thought Fred and I should 've got E in everything , because we exceeded expectations just by turning up for the exams . '' 
`` So after E , it 's A for ` Acceptable , ' and that 's the last pass grade , is n't it ? '' 
`` T ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` have you ? '' 
`` What is it this time , Miss Granger ? '' 
`` I 've already read chapter two , '' 
`` He says that counterjinxes are improperly named , '' 
`` But I disagree , '' 
`` Yes , I do , '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` Do n't you get involved ! '' 
`` I wish she had n't taken points from you , but I think she 's right to warn you not to lose your temper with Umbridge , '' 
`` Here , '' 
`` She 's an awful woman , '' 
`` No ... I mean , something about what a dreadful teacher she is , and how we 're not going to learn any defense from her at all , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` You know , I was thinking today ... '' 
`` Well -- learn Defense Against the Dark Arts ourselves , '' 
`` But this is much more important than homework ! '' 
`` Do n't be silly , of course there is ! '' 
`` I mean , all right , we can go and look jinxes up in the library and try and practice them , I suppose -- '' 
`` No , I agree , we 've gone past the stage where we can just learn things out of books , '' 
`` No , no , I 'm not talking about Lupin , '' 
`` Is n't it obvious ? '' 
`` But I 'm not a teacher , I ca n't -- '' 
`` Harry , you 're the best in the year at Defense Against the Dark Arts , '' 
`` No I 'm not , you 've beaten me in every test -- '' 
`` Actually , I have n't , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` do n't you see ? This ... this is exactly why we need you ... We need to know what it 's r-really like ... facing him ... facing V-Voldemort . '' 
`` Well ... think about it , '' 
`` Well , I 'm off to bed , '' 
`` I was wondering , '' 
`` whether you 'd thought any more about Defense Against the Dark Arts , Harry . '' 
`` And ? '' 
`` Yes , Harry , '' 
`` but all the same , there 's no point pretending that you 're not good at Defense Against the Dark Arts , because you are . You were the only person last year who could throw off the Imperius Curse completely , you can produce a Patronus , you can do all sorts of stuff that full-grown wizards ca n't , Viktor always said -- '' 
`` Ho ho , '' 
`` So what if I am ? '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` Well , I think you might be surprised how many people would be interested in hearing what you 've got to say , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` Because , '' 
`` I do n't think Umbridge would be very happy if she found out what we were up to . '' 
`` I mean , he 's been on the run for over two years , has n't he , and I know that ca n't have been a laugh , but at least he was free , was n't he ? And now he 's just shut up all the time with that lunatic elf . '' 
`` The trouble is , '' 
`` Listen , Ron and I have been sounding out people who we thought might want to learn some proper Defense Against the Dark Arts , and there are a couple who seem interested . We 've told them to meet us in Hogsmeade . '' 
`` Do n't worry , Harry , '' 
`` You 've got enough on your plate without Sirius too . '' 
`` Malfoy ? '' 
`` Well ... yes ... maybe ... '' 
`` Oh -- no , '' 
`` no , it 's always packed and really noisy . I 've told the others to meet us in the Hog 's Head , that other pub , you know the one , it 's not on the main road . I think it 's a bit ... you know ... dodgy ... but students do n't normally go in there , so I do n't think we 'll be overheard . '' 
`` Well , come on , '' 
`` Has it occurred to you Umbridge might be under that ? '' 
`` Umbridge is shorter than that woman , '' 
`` Three butterbeers , please , '' 
`` We could order anything we liked in here , I bet that bloke would sell us anything , he would n't care . I 've always wanted to try firewhisky -- '' 
`` You -- are -- a -- prefect , '' 
`` Yes , well , the idea seemed quite popular , '' 
`` I 've told you , they just want to hear what you 've got to say , '' 
`` You do n't have to do anything yet , I 'll speak to them first . '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` because nobody could call that Defense Against the Dark Arts '' 
`` Hear , hear , '' 
`` well , I thought it would be good if we , well , took matters into our own hands . '' 
`` Of course I do , '' 
`` But I want more than that , I want to be properly trained in Defense because ... because ... '' 
`` Because Lord Voldemort 's back . '' 
`` Well ... that 's the plan anyway , '' 
`` Well , Dumbledore believes it -- '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` that 's really not what this meeting was supposed to be about -- '' 
`` It 's okay , Hermione , '' 
`` So , '' 
`` Yes , well , '' 
`` moving on ... the point is , are we agreed we want to take lessons from Harry ? '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` I 'm sure we can find a night that suits everyone , '' 
`` but you know , this is rather important , we 're talking about learning to defend ourselves against V-Voldemort 's Death Eaters -- '' 
`` Well said ! '' 
`` We think the reason Umbridge does n't want us trained in Defense Against the Dark Arts , '' 
`` is that she 's got some ... some mad idea that Dumbledore could use the students in the school as a kind of private army . She thinks he 'd mobilize us against the Ministry . '' 
`` No , he has n't , '' 
`` Great tall flaming creatures that gallop across the ground burning everything in front of -- '' 
`` They do n't exist , Neville , '' 
`` I 'm sorry , but where 's the proof of that ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` yes , we were , you 're right ... '' 
`` Well , once a week sounds cool , '' 
`` Yes , yes , we know about the Quidditch , '' 
`` Right , well , we 'll try to find somewhere , '' 
`` We 'll send a message round to everybody when we 've got a time and a place for the first meeting . '' 
`` I-I think everybody should write their name down , just so we know who was here . But I also think , '' 
`` that we all ought to agree not to shout about what we 're doing . So if you sign , you 're agreeing not to tell Umbridge -- or anybody else -- what we 're up to . '' 
`` Well , I think that went quite well , '' 
`` I do n't like him much either , '' 
`` but he overheard me talking to Ernie and Hannah at the Hufflepuff table and he seemed really interested in coming , so what could I say ? But the more people the better really -- I mean , Michael Corner and his friends would n't have come if he had n't been going out with Ginny -- '' 
`` They met at the Yule Ball and they got together at the end of last year , '' 
`` Hmm ... I could do with a new quill . '' 
`` The dark one , '' 
`` Big surprise , '' 
`` Ginny used to fancy Harry , but she gave up on him months ago . Not that she does n't like you , of course , '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Yes , I think I 'll have this one ... '' 
`` Ron , '' 
`` this is exactly why Ginny has n't told you she 's seeing Michael , she knew you 'd take it badly . So do n't harp on about it , for heaven 's sake . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` she just could n't keep her eyes off you , could she ? '' 
`` Well , it 's an old-fashioned rule , '' 
`` but it says in Hogwarts , A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls . Anyway , why were you trying to get in there ? '' 
`` They ca n't have done , '' 
`` Well , put it this way , '' 
`` it 'll make Eloise Midgen 's acne look like a couple of cute freckles . Come on , let 's get down to breakfast and see what the others think ... I wonder whether this has been put up in all the Houses ? '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Is Hedwig okay ? '' 
`` Obviously , '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Do n't rise , '' 
`` Salamander blood , Harry ! '' 
`` I 'll pretend to be ill and do Snape 's essay instead , then I wo n't have to stay up half the night ... '' 
`` You ca n't skive off Divination , '' 
`` I do n't hate her , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` look on the bright side -- at least now you 'll have time to do Snape 's essay ! '' 
`` I ca n't , they 're not technically doing anything wrong , '' 
`` They 're quite within their rights to eat the foul things themselves , and I ca n't find a rule that says the other idiots are n't entitled to buy them , not unless they 're proven to be dangerous in some way , and it does n't look as though they are ... '' 
`` They really know their stuff ... '' 
`` Oh , they only know flashy stuff that 's no real use to anyone , '' 
`` Well , it was better than the Three Broomsticks ! '' 
`` And if we do get expelled ? '' 
`` I know it was ... I just wondered what Sirius thought , '' 
`` Well , Sirius , it 's just that there were only four of you meeting in the Shrieking Shack when you were at school , '' 
`` and all of you could transform into animals and I suppose you could all have squeezed under a single Invisibility Cloak if you 'd wanted to . But there are twenty-eight of us and none of us is an Animagus , so we would n't need so much an Invisibility Cloak as an Invisibility Marquee -- '' 
`` Why did he -- ? '' 
`` It would 've been really annoying if you had n't explained yourself properly . '' 
`` I was just wondering , '' 
`` whether we 're doing the right thing , starting this Defense Against the Dark Arts group . '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Do you honestly trust his judgment ? '' 
`` This room is n't just some mad idea of Dobby 's ; Dumbledore knows about it too , he mentioned it to me at the Yule Ball . '' 
`` Oh well , that 's all right then , '' 
`` And Umbridge ? '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` And just look at these books ! '' 
`` A Compendium of Common Curses and Their Counter-Actions ... The Dark Arts Outsmarted ... Self-Defensive Spellwork ... wow ... '' 
`` Harry , this is wonderful , there 's everything we need here ! '' 
`` I think we ought to elect a leader , '' 
`` Yes , but I think we ought to vote on it properly , '' 
`` I also think we ought to have a name , '' 
`` I was thinking , '' 
`` All in favor of the D.A. ? '' 
`` That 's a majority -- motion passed ! '' 
`` shall we get practicing then ? I was thinking , the first thing we should do is Expelliarmus , you know , the Disarming Charm . I know it 's pretty basic but I 've found it really useful -- '' 
`` Hey , Harry , '' 
`` have you checked the time ? '' 
`` That was really , really good , Harry , '' 
`` Only once , '' 
`` You see the numerals around the edge of the coins ? '' 
`` On real Galleons that 's just a serial number referring to the goblin who cast the coin . On these fake coins , though , the numbers will change to reflect the time and date of the next meeting . The coins will grow hot when the date changes , so if you 're carrying them in a pocket you 'll be able to feel them . We take one each , and when Harry sets the date of the next meeting he 'll change the numbers on his coin , and because I 've put a Protean Charm on them , they 'll all change to mimic his . '' 
`` Well -- I thought it was a good idea , '' 
`` I mean , even if Umbridge asked us to turn out our pockets , there 's nothing fishy about carrying a Galleon , is there ? But ... well , if you do n't want to use them ... '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Well , the Sorting Hat did seriously consider putting me in Ravenclaw during my Sorting , '' 
`` but it decided on Gryffindor in the end . So does that mean we 're using the Galleons ? '' 
`` Well ... yes , '' 
`` Well , that 's a good sign , I never feel you perform as well in exams if you 're not a bit nervous , '' 
`` Look what it does ... '' 
`` I wanted to have it chewing up a serpent to represent Slytherin , you know , but there was n't time . Anyway ... good luck , Ronald ! '' 
`` Do n't let Ron see what 's on those Slytherins ' badges , '' 
`` Good luck , Ron , '' 
`` Have you seen Ron ? '' 
`` I think he 's avoiding us , '' 
`` Where have you been ? '' 
`` You look frozen , '' 
`` -- if I was n't so lousy at Quidditch -- '' 
`` -- it 's got nothing to do with that -- '' 
`` -- it was that song that wound me up -- '' 
`` -- it would 've wound anyone up -- '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Well , it 's cold out there ! '' 
`` I 'm sorry ! '' 
`` You ought to go and see Madam Pomfrey , Hagrid , '' 
`` Did the giants beat you up , Hagrid ? '' 
`` We guessed , '' 
`` And you found them ? '' 
`` Did n't you know ? '' 
`` Oh , Hagrid , do n't , it 's not hygien -- '' 
`` Ooooh , Dijon ? '' 
`` I 've been there on holiday , did you see -- ? '' 
`` Is that all ? '' 
`` Whose head ? '' 
`` What has happened to you ? How did you sustain those injuries ? '' 
`` You tripped , '' 
`` Not yet , '' 
`` Um ... what sort of thing are you planning to do with us in class , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Erm ... special in what way ? '' 
`` Look , Hagrid , '' 
`` Professor Umbridge wo n't be at all happy if you bring anything to class that 's too dangerous -- '' 
`` Dangerous ? '' 
`` Hagrid , you 've got to pass Umbridge 's inspection , and to do that it would really be better if she saw you teaching us how to look after porlocks , how to tell the difference between knarls and hedgehogs , stuff like that ! '' 
`` The stuff I 've got 's much more impressive , I 've bin bringin ' ’em on fer years , I reckon I 've got the on ' y domestic herd in Britain -- '' 
`` Hagrid ... please ... '' 
`` Then I 'll go back again tomorrow , '' 
`` Gits ... '' 
`` Well , I tried , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` He says he wants them to be a surprise . I tried to explain about Umbridge , but he just does n't get it . He kept saying nobody in their right mind would rather study knarls than chimaeras -- oh I do n't think he 's got a chimaera , '' 
`` oh ! '' 
`` Righ ' , now , who can tell me why some o ' you can see them an ' some ca n't ? '' 
`` The only people who can see thestrals , '' 
`` are people who have seen death . '' 
`` You hag , you evil hag ! '' 
`` That foul , lying , twisting old gargoyle ! '' 
`` Well , it 's like Hagrid said , they can look after themselves , '' 
`` and I suppose a teacher like Grubbly-Plank would n't usually show them to us before N.E.W.T. level , but , well , they are very interesting , are n't they ? The way some people can see them and some ca n't ! I wish I could . '' 
`` Ignore them , just ignore them , '' 
`` Dumbledore wants to stop you having those dreams about Voldemort , '' 
`` See you , then ... '' 
`` We 'll be in the library , Harry , '' 
`` Only if you do , '' 
`` Oh , it 's okay if you do n't , '' 
`` Do n't worry . I-I 'll see you around . '' 
`` Oooh , yes ! '' 
`` How did it go ? '' 
`` Are you all right , Harry ? '' 
`` I saw that door when your dad took me down to the courtrooms for my hearing and it 's definitely the same one he was guarding when the snake bit him . '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` Well , I do n't know , '' 
`` Because no one really seems to know what they do in there ... Weird place to have a weapon ... '' 
`` It 's not weird at all , it makes perfect sense , '' 
`` I just feel a bit ... I do n't like Occlumency much ... '' 
`` I expect anyone would feel shaky if they 'd had their mind attacked over and over again , '' 
`` How do those hats work , then ? '' 
`` Well , write it in your homework planner then ! '' 
`` Shhh ! '' 
`` What other options does he have ? '' 
`` He can hardly say , ` Sorry everyone , Dumbledore warned me this might happen , the Azkaban guards have joined Lord Voldemort ' -- stop whimpering , Ron -- ` and now Voldemort 's worst supporters have broken out too . ' I mean , he 's spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars , has n't he ? '' 
`` Oh my -- '' 
`` It 's ... horrible , '' 
`` Bode . It rings a bell ... '' 
`` We saw him , '' 
`` Oh come on , Ron ! '' 
`` I do n't think anyone could put Devil 's Snare in a pot and not realize it tries to kill whoever touches it ? This -- this was murder ... A clever murder , as well ... If the plant was sent anonymously , how 's anyone ever going to find out who did it ? '' 
`` I 've heard Dad talk about him at home ! He was an Unspeakable -- he worked in the Department of Mysteries ! '' 
`` To send a letter , '' 
`` They obviously ca n't talk freely in the staffroom anymore , '' 
`` Maybe it 's a bit like an illness , '' 
`` I just wish the door would open , I 'm sick of standing staring at it -- '' 
`` That 's not funny , '' 
`` Maybe what ? '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Well , bring her along if you must , '' 
`` I have n't got time to tell you now , I 've got to answer this quickly -- '' 
`` Harry ! Harry , over here ! '' 
`` You 're early ! '' 
`` It 's none of your business if Harry 's been with a hundred girls , '' 
`` Yes , I suppose you are , '' 
`` Pretty girl , is she , Harry ? '' 
`` One more word about Harry 's love life and the deal 's off and that 's a promise , '' 
`` You have n't mentioned a deal yet , Miss Prissy , you just told me to turn up . Oh , one of these days ... '' 
`` Yes , yes , one of these days you 'll write more horrible stories about Harry and me , '' 
`` How has that made you feel , Harry ? Betrayed ? Distraught ? Misunderstood ? '' 
`` He feels angry , of course , '' 
`` As a matter of fact , '' 
`` that 's exactly what Little Miss Perfect does want . '' 
`` Yes , I do , '' 
`` The true story . All the facts . Exactly as Harry reports them . He 'll give you all the details , he 'll tell you the names of the undiscovered Death Eaters he saw there , he 'll tell you what Voldemort looks like now -- oh , get a grip on yourself , '' 
`` We do n't need another story about how Harry 's lost his marbles ! '' 
`` You mean the Prophet wo n't print it because Fudge wo n't let them , '' 
`` So the Daily Prophet exists to tell people what they want to hear , does it ? '' 
`` Well , this is your chance to raise the tone of it a bit , is n't it ? '' 
`` Some people wo n't , '' 
`` But the Daily Prophet 's version of the Azkaban breakout had some gaping holes in it . I think a lot of people will be wondering whether there is n't a better explanation of what happened , and if there 's an alternative story available , even if it is published in a '' 
`` All right , let 's say for a moment I 'll do it , '' 
`` Well , yes , '' 
`` Okay , Harry ? '' 
`` Fire away , then , Rita , '' 
`` Oh , I forgot to ask you , '' 
`` Well , you see , '' 
`` You should have told her differently '' 
`` You should have said it was really annoying , but I 'd made you promise to come along to the Three Broomsticks , and you really did n't want to go , you 'd much rather spend the whole day with her , but unfortunately you thought you really ought to meet me and would she please , please come along with you , and hopefully you 'd be able to get away more quickly ? And it might have been a good idea to mention how ugly you think I am too , '' 
`` Harry , you 're worse than Ron ... Well , no , you 're not , '' 
`` Girls do n't often ask questions like that , '' 
`` I 'm not saying what she did was sensible , '' 
`` Oh come on , '' 
`` Actually , I dunno how she got so good , seeing how we never let her play with us ... '' 
`` She 's been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you were n't looking , '' 
`` Has Ron saved a goal yet ? '' 
`` You know , Quidditch was about the only thing in this place worth staying for . '' 
`` That 's the trouble with Quidditch , '' 
`` Well , it does ! '' 
`` Maybe not , '' 
`` but at least my happiness does n't depend on Ron 's goalkeeping ability . '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` That 's what I thought , '' 
`` Harry , d’you mind if we -- ? '' 
`` Ah well ... '' 
`` This woman recommends you try a good course of Shock Spells at St. Mungo 's , '' 
`` Here 's another one you 've convinced , Harry ! '' 
`` Oh Harry , do n't you see ? '' 
`` If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview , it was banning it ! '' 
`` And then they spotted me , and obviously they know I know you , so they were bombarding me with questions , '' 
`` And the best bit is , '' 
`` they ca n't contradict you , because they ca n't admit they 've read the article ! '' 
`` Dad 's reprinting ! '' 
`` So that 's why they killed him , '' 
`` He was in the Department of Mysteries corridor that day ! Your dad said he was probably trying to sneak down and find out what happened in my hearing , but what if -- '' 
`` Sturgis , '' 
`` Sturgis Podmore , '' 
`` Arrested for trying to get through a door . Lucius got him too . I bet he did it the day you saw him there , Harry . Sturgis had Moody 's Invisibility Cloak , right ? So what if he was standing guard by the door , invisible , and Malfoy heard him move , or guessed he was there , or just did the Imperius Curse on the off chance that a guard was there ? So when Sturgis next had an opportunity -- probably when it was his turn on SEEN AND UNFORESEEN ` 589 ` guard duty again -- he tried to get into the department to steal the weapon for Voldemort -- Ron , be quiet -- but he got caught and sent to Azkaban ... '' 
`` Rookwood used to work there ... Maybe Voldemort 'll send Rookwood to do it ? '' 
`` But you should n't have seen this at all , Harry . '' 
`` You 're supposed to be learning how to close your mind to this sort of thing , '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` Well , I think we should just try and forget what you saw , '' 
`` So you 've stopped having funny dreams ? '' 
`` Well , I do n't think Snape should stop until you 're absolutely sure you can control them ! '' 
`` Just drop it , Hermione , okay ? '' 
`` How can that come as a shock ? '' 
`` That 's for Quidditch practice , '' 
`` We 've got about as much chance of winning the Quidditch Cup this year as Dad 's got of becoming Minister of Magic ... '' 
`` I saw Cho earlier , '' 
`` and she looked really miserable too ... Have you two had a row again ? '' 
`` Well , it 's a very responsible job , is n't it ? '' 
`` What is it , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Into the forest ? '' 
`` You did n't bring your crossbow the day you showed us the thestrals , '' 
`` Why does Firenze leaving make a difference ? '' 
`` They attacked him ? '' 
`` Hagrid , would it be all right if we lit our wands ? '' 
`` Good ! '' 
`` But you 've lasted this long -- '' 
`` Hagrid , '' 
`` Hagrid , you told us , '' 
`` you told us none of them wanted to come ! '' 
`` But why ? '' 
`` Harmless ! '' 
`` So this is why it took you two months to get home ! '' 
`` Small ? '' 
`` See -- he 's my brother ! '' 
`` Oh yes , tiny ! '' 
`` Oh Hagrid , why on earth did n't you let him ! '' 
`` You have to keep him tied up ? '' 
`` So what is it you want Harry and Ron and me to do ? '' 
`` What -- what does that involve , exactly ? '' 
`` Wha -- no ! '' 
`` Hagrid , no , do n't wake him , really , we do n't need -- '' 
`` Oh Hagrid , do n't , '' 
`` is Harry , Grawp ! Harry Potter ! He migh ' be comin ' ter visit yeh if I have ter go away , understand ? '' 
`` No , not at all , '' 
`` Hagrid , '' 
`` Please , Professor , '' 
`` when will we find out our results ? '' 
`` let me show you to the staffroom ... I daresay you 'd like a cup of tea after your journey ... '' 
`` I mistranslated ` ehwaz , ' '' 
`` it could be the one mistake that makes the difference between a pass and a fail . And what 's more , someone 's put another niffler in Umbridge 's office , I do n't know how they got it through that new door , but I just walked past there and Umbridge is shrieking her head off -- by the sound of it , it tried to take a chunk out of her leg -- '' 
`` It is not good ! '' 
`` Oh , you 're so naive sometimes , Harry , you really think Umbridge will wait for proof ? '' 
`` Only ! '' 
`` Well , I think I 've done all right in Arithmancy , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` It 's Minerva McGonagall ! '' 
`` On what grounds are you attacking him ? He has done nothing , nothing to warrant such -- '' 
`` RUDDY COWARDS ! HAVE SOME O ' THAT -- AN ' THAT -- '' 
`` Oh my -- '' 
`` That evil woman ! '' 
`` It 'll be his giant blood , '' 
`` I suppose so , '' 
`` Umbridge hates part-humans , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` The Minister would n't want you to break the law , Professor Umbridge ! '' 
`` We 'll have to , Harry , she 'll force it out of you anyway , what 's ... what 's the point ... ? '' 
`` I 'm -- I 'm sorry everyone , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` well , he was trying to speak to Professor Dumbledore ... '' 
`` Well ... no ! '' 
`` But -- but we needed to tell him something important ! '' 
`` We ... we wanted to tell him it 's r-ready ! '' 
`` The ... the weapon , '' 
`` Y-y-yes , '' 
`` We do n't r-r-really understand it , '' 
`` Lead me to the weapon , '' 
`` I 'm not showing ... them , '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` fine ... let them see it , I hope they use it on you ! In fact , I wish you 'd invite loads and loads of people to come and see ! Th-that would serve you right -- oh , I 'd love it if the wh-whole school knew where it was , and how to u-use it , and then if you annoy any of them they 'll be able to s-sort you out ! '' 
`` Of course not , '' 
`` In there , of course , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` It 's a bit further in ! '' 
`` Anything could be listening in here -- '' 
`` I want us heard , '' 
`` Not far now ! '' 
`` Do n't call them that ! '' 
`` Be quiet ! '' 
`` Please , '' 
`` please , do n't attack us , we do n't think like her , we are n't Ministry of Magic employees ! We only came in here because we hoped you 'd drive her off for us -- '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Please -- I did n't mean that ! I just hoped you 'd be able to -- to help us -- '' 
`` You said you did n't hurt the innocent ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Goodness , '' 
`` he -- he remembered ! '' 
`` I do n't know ! '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` We need to get back up to the castle , '' 
`` Well , we ca n't do anything without wands , '' 
`` Yeah , we were just wondering that , '' 
`` Well , we need three , '' 
`` I 'm not staying behind ! '' 
`` Never , ever again ... that was the worst -- '' 
`` Where do we go from here , then ? '' 
`` We wo n't need to get out till we 've found Sirius -- '' 
`` Do n't go calling for him , though ! '' 
`` Dad said the Ministry were breeding -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Wait ! '' 
`` Flagrate ! '' 
`` Careful ! '' 
`` Harry , let 's go , okay ? '' 
`` Nobody 's talking , Harry ! '' 
`` What do you mean , ` in there ' ? '' 
`` There is n't any ` in there , ' it 's just an archway , there 's no room for anybody to be there -- Harry , stop it , come away -- '' 
`` Harry , we are supposed to be here for Sirius ! '' 
`` That 's what I 've been trying to -- well , come on , then ! '' 
`` I do n't know , but whatever it was , it was dangerous , '' 
`` What 's wrong ? '' 
`` Get out of the way ! '' 
`` Alohomora ! '' 
`` Right , we 're leaving that room , '' 
`` It ca n't be , Harry could get through all the doors in his dream , '' 
`` Something blibbering , no doubt , '' 
`` You said it was row ninety-seven , '' 
`` We need to go right , I think , '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` None of the rest of us are here ... '' 
`` Harry , I do n't think you should touch it , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Smash shelves -- '' 
`` Dumbledore never told you ? '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
`` They must have gone the wrong way ! '' 
`` What do we do ? '' 
`` Accio Wand ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Collo -- '' 
`` oh ! '' 
`` Yes , they 're very complimentary about you now , Harry , '' 
`` ` A lone voice of truth ... perceived as unbalanced , yet never wavered in his story ... forced to bear ridicule and slander ... ' Hmmm , '' 
`` I notice they do n't mention the fact that it was them doing all the ridiculing and slandering , though ... '' 
`` ` Voldemort 's Last Attempt to Take Over , pages two to four , What the Ministry Should Have Told Us , page five , Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore , pages six to eight , Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter , page nine ... ' Well , '' 
`` it 's certainly given them lots to write about . And that interview with Harry is n't exclusive , it 's the one that was in The Quibbler months ago ... '' 
`` He got a very good price for it too , so we 're going to go on an expedition to Sweden this summer and see if we can catch a Crumple-Horned Snorkack . '' 
`` That sounds lovely . '' 
`` So anyway , '' 
`` what 's going on in school ? '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Must be doing all right out of that joke shop , eh ? '' 
`` So has all the trouble stopped now Dumbledore 's back ? '' 
`` Madam Pomfrey says she 's just in shock , '' 
`` Speaking of centaurs , '' 
`` who 's Divination teacher now ? Is Firenze staying ? '' 
`` Say hello to him for us ! '' 
`` Did you really blow up your aunt , Harry ? '' 
`` It 's not funny , Ron , '' 
`` Famous Harry Potter and all that . I 'd hate to see what the Ministry 'd do to me if I blew up an aunt . Mind you , they 'd have to dig me up first , because Mum would 've killed me . Anyway , you can ask Dad yourself this evening . We 're staying at the Leaky Cauldron tonight too ! So you can come to King 's Cross with us tomorrow ! Hermione 's there as well ! '' 
`` But it 'll be fascinating to study them from the wizarding point of view , '' 
`` I 've still got ten Galleons , '' 
`` He 's gorgeous , is n't he ? '' 
`` He did n't mean to , did you , Crookshanks ? '' 
`` That reminds me , you forgot your rat tonic , '' 
`` It 's all right , Crookshanks , '' 
`` Ron , '' 
`` I 'm going to go and ask the driver what 's going on , '' 
`` Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were taken ill on the train , Potter . '' 
`` It is a Gift 82 granted to few . You , boy , '' 
`` We will be covering the basic methods of Divination this year . The first term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves . Next term we shall progress to palmistry . By the way , my dear , '' 
'' I do n't know , '' 
`` You have n't been fired , Hagrid ! '' 
`` Please , sir , '' 
`` please , I could help Neville put it right -- '' 
`` I do n't remember asking you to show off , Miss Granger , '' 
`` Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right ! Why did n't You lie , Hermione ? You should 've said Neville did it all by himself ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Oh -- I had to go back for something . Oh no -- '' 
`` You know how many subjects I 'm taking , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` So , the first question we must ask ourselves is , what is a boggart ? '' 
`` It 's a shape-shifter , '' 
`` He seems like a very good teacher , '' 
`` Crookshanks does n't understand it 's wrong ! '' 
`` Oh , what rubbish , '' 
`` How 's Scabbers ? '' 
`` What 's the matter , Lavender ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` I 'm sorry , Lavender . '' 
`` You -- you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox ? '' 
`` Well , not necessarily by a fox , '' 
`` but I was obviously dreading him dying , was n't l ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` But then , why would you dread him dying ? '' 
`` Well , look at it logically , '' 
`` I mean , Binky did n't even die today , did he ? Lavender just got the news today - '' 
`` Oh , my -- '' 
`` Do you think Black 's still in the castle ? '' 
`` It 's very lucky he picked tonight , you know , '' 
`` Well , well , well , I never thought I 'd meet a third-year class who would n't even recognize a werewolf when they saw one . I shall make a point of informing Professor Dumbledore how very behind you all are ... '' 
`` Please , sir , '' 
`` the werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways . The snout of the werewolf -- '' 
`` Five more points from Gryffindor for being an insufferable know-it-all . '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
'' -- is making me do ? I 've got to scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing . Without magic ! '' 
`` Check who 's in there , Hermione . '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` We can do all our Christmas shopping there ! '' 
`` Ugh , no , Harry wo n't want one of those , they 're for vampires , I expect , '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` But Harry is n't going to keep it ! '' 
`` But what about Sirius Black ? '' 
`` Come on , Hermione , it 's Christmas . Harry deserves a break . '' 
`` You really don ' look well , you know , '' 
`` Harry , listen , '' 
`` He 's not out , is he ? '' 
`` You 'll have to put up a good strong defense , Hagrid , '' 
`` I 'm sure I 've read about a case of hippogriff-baiting , '' 
`` where the hippogriff got off I 'll look it up for you , Hagrid , and see exactly what happened . '' 
`` What 're you two laughing about ? '' 
`` There was n't a card or anything with it . '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` but it 's a bit odd , is n't it ? I mean , this is supposed to be quite a good broom , is n't it ? '' 
`` Well ... who 'd send Harry something as expensive as that , and not even tell him they 'd sent it ? '' 
`` I do n't think anyone should ride that broom just yet ! '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` Well , is n't it obvious ? '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Well -- there might have been ! '' 
`` I suppose so , '' 
`` Oh , well -- you know -- working hard , '' 
`` I could n't do that ! '' 
`` Oh no , it 's wonderful ! '' 
`` SCABBERS ! LOOK ! SCABBERS ! '' 
`` N -- no , '' 
`` Okay , side with Ron , I knew you would ! '' 
`` Of course I did , '' 
`` I ca n't , Harry . I 've still got four hundred and twenty-two pages to read ! '' 
`` Anyway ... '' 
`` Harry , if you go into Hogsmeade again ... I 'll tell Professor Minerva McGonagall about that map ! '' 
`` Have n't you done enough damage this year ? '' 
'' CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 244 He sent me this , '' 
`` Malfoy 's dad 's frightened the Committee into it , '' 
`` Oh , Ron ! '' 
`` Ron , I 'm really , really sorry about Scabbers ... '' 
`` Get off , Ron ! '' 
`` Harry , you 'd better beat him in the Quidditch final ! '' 
`` Maybe -- maybe she went to the bathroom or something ? '' 
`` Wh -- what ? '' 
`` What ? Oh no ! '' 
`` I do n't believe it ! '' 
`` No , I 'm not ! '' 
`` I just made a mistake , that 's all ! I 'd better go and see Professor Flitwick and say sorry ... I 'll see you in Divination ! '' 
`` The fates have informed me that your examination in June will concern the Orb , and I am anxious to give you sufficient practice . '' 
`` Well , honestly ... ` the fates have informed her ' who sets the exam ? She does ! What an amazing prediction ! '' 
`` Crystal gazing is a particularly refined art , '' 
`` This is such a waste of time , '' 
`` Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy portents within their Orb ? '' 
`` Oh , for goodness ' sake ! '' 
`` Fine ! '' 
`` Fine ! '' 
`` I give up ! I 'm leaving ! '' 
`` I ca n't work , I ca n't concentrate , '' 
`` You 're going to be fine , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` P -- P -- Professor Minerva McGonagall ! '' 
`` Sh -- she said I 'd failed everything ! '' 
`` Ron , your dad works for the Ministry , you ca n't go saying things like that to his boss ! '' 
`` How long have you known ? '' 
`` Ages , '' 
`` Both , '' 
`` I 'm not , '' 
`` We attacked a teacher ... We attacked a teacher ... '' 
`` Okay , say Pettigrew could turn into a rat -- there are millions of rats -- how 's he supposed to know which one he 's after if he was locked up in Azkaban ? '' 
`` What do you mean ? '' 
`` Ah , you 're awake ! '' 
`` That was because you were knocked out , Professor ! '' 
`` He hates Sirius , '' 
`` is more time . '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` Three turns ? What 's he talking about ? What are we supposed to do ? '' 
`` Harry , come here , '' 
`` Here -- '' 
`` Ready ? '' 
`` In here ! '' 
`` We 've gone back in time , '' 
`` Shh ! Listen ! Someone 's coming ! I think -- I think it might be us ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I 'm sure it 's us . It does n't sound like more than three people ... and we 're walking slowly because we 're under the Invisibility Cloak -- '' 
`` We 've gone down the front steps ... '' 
`` It 's called a Time-Turner , '' 
`` We 're about to come out ! '' 
`` Here we come ! '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Not to interfere ! Lupin 's going to run into the forest , right at us ! '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
`` Shh , Fang , it 's us ! '' 
`` That was really close ! '' 
`` I ca n't see what 's going on -- we wo n't know when it 's time -- '' 
`` Look ! '' 
'' \ Who 's that ? Someone 's coming back out of the castle ! '' 
`` The executioner ! He 's gone to get the dementors ! This is it , Hermione -- '' 
`` Okay -- I can hear Dumbledore , '' 
`` What was that ? '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` but I ca n't stand another year like this one . That Time-Turner , it was driving me mad . I 've handed it in . Without Muggle Studies and Divination , I 'll be able to have a normal schedule again . '' 
`` Goodness , did n't you know , I 'd have found out everything I could if it was me , '' 
`` Do either of you know what house you 'll be in ? I 've been asking around , and I hope I 'm in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best ; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw would n't be too bad ... Anyway , we 'd better go and look for Neville 's toad . You two had better change , you know , I expect we 'll be there soon . '' 
`` What has been going on ? '' 
'' The Harry Potter ? '' 
`` I do hope they start right away , there 's so much to learn , I 'm particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it 's supposed to be very difficult - '' 
`` You 'll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- '' 
`` I almost told your brother , '' 
`` Percy -- he 's a prefect , he 'd put a stop to this . '' 
`` All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you 're on the train home tomorrow , you 're so -- '' 
`` We 've got to go , we 3 re going to be late . '' 
`` I 'm coming with you , '' 
`` If any dog needs exercise , that one does . '' 
`` You do n't use your eyes , any of you , do you ? '' 
`` Miss Granger ! '' 
`` Just a bit of toast , '' 
`` Ca n't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . '' 
`` I knew it , '' 
`` Snape -- look . '' 
`` He 's doing something -- jinxing the broom , '' 
`` Just one , '' 
`` We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that 's all , '' 
`` Do n't play , '' 
`` Pretend to break your leg , '' 
`` What happened ? '' 
`` Go to Professor Minerva McGonagall ! '' 
`` I 've found Flamel ! I told you I 'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this : ` Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' ! '' 
`` Stay there ! '' 
`` I never thought to look in here ! '' 
`` Nicolas Flamel , '' 
`` is the only known maker of the Sorcerer 's Stone ! '' 
`` Oh , honestly , do n't you two read ? Look -- read that , there . '' 
`` See ? '' 
`` Just as long as we 're not wiping you off the field , '' 
`` Now , do n't forget , it 's Locomotor Mortis , '' 
`` Harry , where have you been ? '' 
`` So you mean the Stone 's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? '' 
`` What was he hiding behind his back ? '' 
`` So what on earths Hagrid up to ? '' 
`` Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , '' 
`` Hagrid , '' 
`` how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? '' 
`` It 'll all be over at midnight on Saturday , '' 
`` I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It 's one o'clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . '' 
`` Are there many of them in here ? '' 
`` You do n't think they 've been hurt , do you ? '' 
`` Yes -- of course -- but there 's no wood ! '' 
`` Oh , right ! '' 
`` These birds ... they ca n't be here just for decoration , '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Well , I got back all right , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` if he did -- I mean to say that 's terrible -- you could have been killed . '' 
`` Hope you have -- er -- a good holiday , ''
