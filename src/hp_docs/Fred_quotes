`` Tie that around the bars , '' 
`` Do n't worry , '' 
`` and stand back . '' 
`` Out of the way , Harry . '' 
`` A lot of wizards think it 's a waste of time , knowing this sort of Muggle trick , '' 
`` but we feel they 're skills worth learning , even if they are a bit slow . '' 
`` A bit more , '' 
`` Very fishy , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` put it this way - house-elves have got powerful magic of their own , but they ca n't usually use it without their master 's permission . I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com ing back to Hogwarts . Someone 's idea of a joke . Can you think of anyone at school with a grudge against you ? '' 
`` And when Voldemort disappeared , '' 
`` Beds empty ! No note ! Cargone - could have crashed - out of my mind with worry - did you care ? - never , as long as I 've lived - you wait until your father gets home , we never had trouble like this from Bill or Charlie or Percy - '' 
`` Perfect Percy , '' 
`` It was cloudy , Mum ! '' 
`` Yeah , she 'll be wanting your autograph , Harry , '' 
`` Blimey , I 'm tired , '' 
`` He knows his household pests , all right , it 's a wonderful book ... '' 
`` Mum fancies him , '' 
`` Pitiful , '' 
`` Find anything , Dad ? '' 
`` The new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan - bet it 's a witch . '' 
`` Wish I knew what he was up to , '' 
`` Gotcha ! '' 
`` When I get married , '' 
`` I wo n't be bothering with any of this nonsense . You can all wear what you like , and I 'll put a full Body Bind Curse on Mum until it 's all over . '' 
`` They 'll need help understanding our English customs , I 'll look after them ... '' 
`` Not so fast , Your Holeyness , '' 
`` Here -- permettez-moi to assiter vous , '' 
`` Yes , River , I can , '' 
`` Agreed , '' 
`` Well , who would n't want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he 's been putting in ? '' 
`` We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore 's Army , '' 
`` A teenagers ' gang that 's about to take him on , which no one she has dared to do ! '' 
`` Ministry-loving , family-disowning , power-hungry moron . '' 
`` Well , you ca n't say fairer that that , '' 
`` Nice night for it ! '' 
`` Harry 's wand ? '' 
`` Homework , '' 
`` Now , Mum , '' 
`` You 're JOKING ! '' 
`` I 'm going for it ! '' 
`` Moody ! '' 
`` Never had a lesson like it , '' 
`` Fighting the Dark Arts , '' 
`` An Age Line ! '' 
`` Done it , '' 
`` The Aging Potion , dung brains , '' 
`` Ready ? '' 
`` I suggest you both go up to Madam Pomfrey . She is already tending to Miss Fawcett , of Ravenclaw , and Mr. Summers , of Hufflepuff , both of whom decided to age themselves up a little too . Though I must say , neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours . '' 
`` It 'd be doin ' ’em an unkindness , Hermione , '' 
`` You should 've told us you 'd entered ! '' 
`` Nice look , Ron ... go well with your dress robes , that will . '' 
`` Because George wants to invite him to the ball , '' 
`` Nose out , Ron , or I 'll burn that for you too , '' 
`` Well , you 'd better hurry up , mate , or all the good ones will be gone , '' 
`` Angelina , '' 
`` Good point , '' 
`` There you go , '' 
`` Hello , Ludo Bagman , '' 
`` Fine -- we wo n't ask you what you 're doing , if you do n't ask us , '' 
`` Well , do n't let us hold you up , '' 
`` I 've told you before , Ron , keep your nose out if you like it the shape it is . Ca n't see why you would , but -- '' 
`` Exploding Snap , anyone ? '' 
`` It does n't matter , '' 
`` All right , all right , if you really want to know ... it was Ludo Bagman . '' 
`` You remember that bet we had with him at the Quidditch World Cup ? About how Ireland would win , but Krum would get the Snitch ? '' 
`` So , '' 
`` it vanished , did n't it ? By next morning , it had gone ! '' 
`` In the end , he turned pretty nasty , '' 
`` Right in one , '' 
`` He put a bet on you , mate , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` He is mental , '' 
`` Just do n't tell your mum where you got it ... although she might not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore , come to think of it ... '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` mortal peril . '' 
`` you can have one for free . '' 
`` Oh blimey , I forgot about those , '' 
`` Here -- '' 
`` Just dab it on , that bruise 'll be gone within the hour , '' 
`` You do n't pay here , '' 
`` Have n't you girls found our special WonderWitch products yet ? '' 
`` There you go , '' 
`` Guaranteed ten-second pimple vanisher , '' 
`` They 're fairly cuddly , yes , '' 
`` That 's three Galleons , nine Sickles , and a Knut , '' 
'' spluttered Slughorn . Harry leapt over a low table and sprinted toward Slughorn 's open potion kit , pulling out jars and pouches , while the terrible CHAPTER EIGHTEEN ` 398 ` sound of Ron 's gargling breath filled the room . Then he found it -- the shriveled kidneylike stone Slughorn had taken from him in Potions . He hurtled back to Ron 's side , wrenched open his jaw , and thrust the bezoar into his mouth . Ron gave a great shudder , a rattling gasp , and his body became limp and still . C H A P T E R N I N E T E E N ` 399 ` ELF TAILS o , all in all , not one of Ron 's better birthdays ? '' 
`` Yeah , when we pictured the scene , he was conscious , '' 
`` We were thinking of buying Zonko 's , '' 
`` A Hogsmeade branch , you know , but a fat lot of good it 'll do us if S CHAPTER NINETEEN ` 400 ` you lot are n't allowed out at weekends to buy our stuff anymore ... But never mind that now . '' 
`` Do Mum and Dad know ? '' 
`` So the poison was in the drink ? '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` but there must be loads of people who 'd like to poison Harry , must n't there ? ` The Chosen One ' and all that ? '' 
`` Anything 's possible , '' 
`` Wood might 've done the Slytherins if he could 've got away with it , '' 
`` How d’you work that out ? '' 
`` We 've been decontaminating this house , it 's been empty for ages and stuff 's been breeding in here . We 've managed to clean out the kitchen , most of the bedrooms , and I think we 're doing the drawing room tomo -- AARGH ! '' 
`` You do n't want to bottle up your anger like that , Harry , let it all out , '' 
`` With distinction , '' 
`` Time is Galleons , little brother , '' 
`` If Mum sees one of them again ... '' 
`` It 's worth the risk , that 's a major meeting they 're having , '' 
`` I thought I heard your voice . '' 
`` You just chuck stuff at the door and if it ca n't make contact the door 's been Imperturbed . I 've been flicking Dungbombs at it from the top of the stairs and they just soar away from it , so there 's no way the Extendable Ears will be able to get under the gap . '' 
`` Git , '' 
`` He applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order , '' 
`` He says he misses the tombs , but , '' 
`` there are compensations ... '' 
`` What d’you mean ? '' 
`` She 's got a job at Gringotts to eemprove ' er Eeenglish -- '' 
`` -- and Bill 's been giving her a lot of private lessons , '' 
`` Because every time Percy 's name 's mentioned , Dad breaks whatever he 's holding and Mum starts crying , '' 
`` Percy and Dad had a row , '' 
`` Only Dad was n't , '' 
`` Dumbledore 's name 's mud with the Ministry these days , see , '' 
`` Uh-oh . '' 
`` Do mine ears deceive me ? '' 
`` Fair point , little bro , '' 
`` You 'll be singing a different tune soon enough , Hermione , '' 
`` So you 've got your exams coming up , have n't you ? They 'll be keeping your noses so hard to that grindstone they 'll be rubbed raw , '' 
`` Kenneth Towler came out in boils , d’you remember ? '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` We 're not going to waste our last year here , though , '' 
`` Ask us no questions and we 'll tell you no lies , Hermione . C’mon , George , if we get there early we might be able to sell a few Extendable Ears before Herbology . '' 
`` We 're paying them ! '' 
`` Rubbish , '' 
`` Excellent , '' 
`` ' Course it is , they 're alive , are n't they ? '' 
`` Put us in detention ? '' 
`` I ca n't stop you eating the stupid things yourselves , but you 're not giving them to first years . '' 
`` She 's there , '' 
`` Ready to show us all up , Ickle Prefect ? '' 
`` Sure you do n't need a lie-down ? It must be , what , a whole week since you were in the hospital wing , that 's a record for you , is n't it ? '' 
`` Here , take this , '' 
`` Yeah , well , I hope he has n't peaked too soon , '' 
`` We 'll take her , '' 
`` Well , that 's nothing to be ashamed of , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` You lot had an inspected lesson yet ? '' 
`` Who 've you got this afternoon ? '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Cheers , '' 
`` What have you been telling people ? '' 
`` Mum told Ron not to spread it around , '' 
`` That 's not what he said , '' 
`` Or any part of your body , really , we 're not fussy where we stick this , '' 
`` Well , time 's ticking on , '' 
`` The prefects as well ? '' 
`` -- but I bet she 'd know what we 'd done , '' 
`` Well , yeah , '' 
`` your temperature 'll go right up -- '' 
`` No , well , you would n't , '' 
`` they 're not in a place we generally display to the public -- '' 
`` -- but they make sitting on a broom a right pain in the -- '' 
`` All right , everyone , listen up , '' 
`` I think a few of mine have ruptured , '' 
`` It 's bizarre , '' 
`` Or the Ministry of Magic Are Morons Group ? '' 
`` more of a name that did n't tell everyone what we were up to , so we can refer to it safely outside meetings . '' 
`` -- we could n't fit in useless loser either -- for his father , you know -- '' 
`` It 's not my fault I did n't , '' 
`` Look , let 's get back to the common room , we 'll be a bit more comfortable there ... '' 
`` Two Galleons each -- watch Fred , now ! '' 
`` Ron and Ginny not here ? '' 
`` Well , he can do it if he does n't think anyone 's watching him , '' 
`` So all we have to do is ask the crowd to turn their backs and talk among themselves every time the Quaffle goes up his end on Saturday . '' 
`` Told you already , we 're not fussed about N.E.W.T.s , '' 
`` Kill him , more like , '' 
`` I have n't got the heart to take the mickey out of him , even , '' 
`` This one 's in two minds , '' 
`` Is that a crime now ? '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Mum ! '' 
`` And last , '' 
`` We 've got it , '' 
`` We 've come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go , '' 
`` Come in here ... '' 
`` It 's a wrench , giving it to you , '' 
`` but we decided last night , your need 's greater than ours . '' 
`` A bit of old parchment ! '' 
`` Well , what would you 've done ? '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` Right into Hogsmeade , '' 
`` There are seven in all . Now , Filch knows about these four '' 
`` but we 're sure we 're the only ones who know about these . Do n't bother with the one behind the mirror on the fourth floor . We used it until last winter , but it 's caved in -- completely blocked . And we do n't reckon anyone 's ever used this one , because the Whomping Willow 's planted right over the entrance . But this one here , this one leads right into the cellar of Honeydukes . We 've used it loads of times . And as you might 've noticed , the entrance is right outside this room , through that one-eyed old crone 's hump . '' 
`` Noble men , working tirelessly to help a new generation of lawbreakers , '' 
`` Do n't forget to wipe it after you 've used it or anyone can read it , '' 
`` So , young Harry , '' 
`` Come on , Ron , you were always saying how boring Scabbers was , '' 
`` His finest hour , '' 
`` The dementors wo n't turn up again , Oliver . Dumbledore 'd go ballistic , '' 
`` Show her your acceleration , Harry ! '' 
`` With a little help from Moony , Pettigrew , Padfoot , and James , '' 
`` Excellent , are we carrying on ? '' 
`` Sorry , did n't see her ! '' 
`` Come off it , Miss ! '' 
`` Well , what are you all waiting for ? '' 
`` Only do n't tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . '' 
`` I tell you , we 're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year , '' 
`` Bet it 's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you . '' 
`` The big one , '' 
`` We know Oliver 's speech by heart , '' 
`` All right there , Harry ? '' 
`` Hey , look -- Harry 's got a Weasley sweater , too ! '' 
`` The whole school 's out there ! ''
