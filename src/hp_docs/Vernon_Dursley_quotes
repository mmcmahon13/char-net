`` Dudley must have left his television on again , the little tyke ! '' 
`` What - the - devil - are - you - doing ? '' 
`` Read it ! '' 
`` You did n't tell us you were n't allowed to use magic outside school , '' 
`` Petunia ! ''

`` His godfather 's dead ? '' 
`` He 's been left a house ? '' 
`` Black family tradition decreed that the house was handed down the direct line , to the next male with the name of ` Black . ' Sirius was the very last of the line as his younger brother , Regulus , predeceased him and both were childless . While his will makes it perfectly plain that he wants you to have the house , it is nevertheless possible that some spell or enchantment has been set upon the place to ensure that it can not be owned by anyone other than a pureblood . '' 
`` Will you get these ruddy things off us ? '' 
`` But it would have been better manners to drink it , you know . ''

`` His godfather 's dead ? '' 
`` Not in the house . '' 
`` Watching the news ... '' 
`` Record numbers of stranded holidaymakers fill airports as the Spanish baggage-handlers ' strike reaches its second week -- '' 
`` Give ’em a lifelong siesta , I would , '' 
`` with his sprinklers on at three in the morning ! '' 
`` Lovely evening ! '' 
`` What the devil do you mean by it , boy ? '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
`` No more do I , '' 
`` We 're not stupid , you know , '' 
`` The noble sport , '' 
`` Firstly , '' 
`` you 'll keep a civil tongue in your head when you 're talking to Marge . '' 
`` Well , Petunia , '' 
`` I 'll be off to the station , then . Want to come along for the ride , Dudders ? '' 
`` Mummy 's bought him a lovely new bow tie . '' 
`` See you in a bit , then , '' 
`` I 'm not taking you , '' 
`` I want to ask you something . '' 
`` So ? '' 
`` And why should I do that ? '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` I shall monitor your behavior carefully during Marge 's visit . If , at the end of it , you 've toed the line and kept to the story , I 'll sign your ruddy form . '' 
`` Tea , Marge ? '' 
`` Who 's looking after the other dogs , Marge ? '' 
`` St. Brutus 's , '' 
`` Er -- '' 
`` If you can speak of your beatings in that casual way , they clearly are n't hitting you hard enough . Petunia , I 'd write if I were you . Make it clear that you approve the use of extreme force in this boy 's case . '' 
`` NOOOOOOO ! '' 
`` COME BACK IN HERE ! '' 
`` Get out , both of you , '' 
`` I 'm not having one in the house , Petunia ! Did n't we swear when we took him in we 'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense ? ''

`` Shake'em off ... shake 'em off , '' 
`` I 'll take them , '' 
`` Do n't touch anything he gives you , Dudley . '' 
`` Yet great puddin ' of a son don ' need fattenin ' anymore , Dursley , don ' worry . '' 
`` Er -- Vernon Dursley ? '' 
`` Er -- I need to be at King 's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts . '' 
`` Do n't talk rubbish , '' 
`` Barking , '' 
`` howling mad , the lot of them . You 'll see . You just wait . All right , we 'll take you to King 's Cross . We 're going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n't bother . '' 
`` Taking Dudley to the hospital , '' 
`` Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine -- platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n't seem to have built it yet , do they ? '' 
`` Have a good term , '' 
`` Ready , are you ? '' 
`` In a manner of speaking , '' 
`` Hurry up , boy , we have n't got all day . ''
