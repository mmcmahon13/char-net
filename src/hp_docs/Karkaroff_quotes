`` Back to the ship , then , '' 
`` I was n't offering it to you , Poliakoff , '' 
`` I notice you have dribbled food all down the front of your robes again , disgusting boy -- '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` Two Hogwarts champions ? I do n't remember anyone telling me the host school is allowed two champions -- or have I not read the rules carefully enough ? '' 
`` We were under the impression that your Age Line would keep out younger contestants , Dumbledore , '' 
`` Mr. Crouch ... Ludo Bagman , '' 
`` you are our -- er -- objective judges . Surely you will agree that this is most irregular ? '' 
`` I insist upon resubmitting the names of the rest of my students , '' 
`` -- in which Durmstrang will most certainly not be competing ! '' 
`` Convenient ? '' 
`` I quite agree , Madame Maxime , '' 
`` We all know Professor Moody considers the morning wasted if he has n't discovered six plots to murder him before lunchtime , '' 
`` It would have needed an exceptionally strong Confundus Charm to bamboozle that goblet into forgetting that only three schools compete in the tournament ... I 'm guessing they submitted Potter 's name under a fourth school , to make sure he was the only one in his category ... '' 
`` You seem to have given this a great deal of thought , Moody , '' 
`` and a very ingenious theory it is -- though of course , I heard you recently got it into your head that one of CHAPTER SEVENTEEN ` 280 ` your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg , and smashed it to pieces before realizing it was a carriage clock . So you 'll understand if we do n't take you entirely seriously ... '' 
`` Well , shall we crack on , then ? '' 
`` Who 's there ? '' 
`` Now , now , Viktor ! '' 
`` do n't go giving away anything else , now , or your charming friend will know exactly where to find us ! '' 
`` Well , Dumbledore , '' 
`` we are all protective of our private domains , are we not ? Do we not jealously guard the halls of learning that have been entrusted to us ? Are we not right to be proud that we alone know our school 's secrets , and right to protect them ? '' 
`` Severus , you can not pretend this is n't happening ! '' 
`` Viktor Krum used an incomplete form of Transfiguration , which was nevertheless effective , and was second to return with his hostage . We award him forty points . '' 
`` feel that this shows moral fiber and merits full marks . However ... Harry Potter 's score is forty-five points . '' 
`` You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic . You have given us to understand that you have important information for us . '' 
`` I have , sir , '' 
`` You must understand , '' 
`` that He-WhoMust-Not-Be-Named operated always in the greatest secrecy ... He preferred that we -- I mean to say , his supporters -- and I regret now , very deeply , that I ever counted myself among them -- '' 
`` Get on with it , '' 
`` I -- I do , '' 
`` There was Antonin Dolohov , '' 
`` Indeed ? '' 
`` I -- I am delighted to hear it ! '' 
`` Why , yes ... there was Rosier , '' 
`` No -- no more than Rosier deserved ! '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` The very same , '' 
`` Not yet ! '' 
`` No ! ''
