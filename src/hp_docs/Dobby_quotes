`` Oh , yes , sir , '' 
`` He has n't got a brother , has he ? '' 
`` I mean , there 's Dumbledore , for one thing - you know who Dumbledore is , do n't you ? '' 
`` Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has ever had . Dobby knows it , sir . Dobby has heard Dumbledore 's powers rival those of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named at the height of his strength . But , sir '' 
`` there are powers Dumbledore does n't ... powers no decent wizard ... '' 
`` Friends who do n't even write to Harry Potter ? '' 
`` How do you know my friends have n't been writing to me ? '' 
'' said the elf sadly . Before Harry could move , Dobby had darted to the bedroom door , pulled it open , and sprinted down the stairs . Mouth dry , stomach lurching , Harry sprang after him , trying not to make a sound . He jumped the last six steps , landing catlike on the hall carpet , looking around for Dobby . From the dining room he heard Vernon Dursley saying , '' 
`` And how did you know I missed the train ? '' 
`` Indeed yes , sir , '' 
`` Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends ! '' 
`` So noble ! So valiant ! But he must save himself , he must , Harry Potter must not - '' 
`` Come , Dobby . I said , come . '' 
`` Got a sock , '' 
`` You 've lost me my servant , boy ! '' 
`` You shall not harm Harry Potter ! '' 
`` You told me all this had nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named , remember ? Well -- '' 
`` It was a clue , sir , '' 
`` And you can take humans with you ? '' 
'' The barman nodded and looked around for the elf . '' 
`` Harry Potter ... can Dobby come and see you sometimes , sir ? '' 
`` Dobby is sorry , sir ! '' 
`` Sorry , I forgot to wrap them ... '' 
`` Dobby must go now , sir , we is already making Christmas dinner in the kitchens ! '' 
`` Winky is over there by the fire , miss , '' 
`` Winky is getting through six bottles a day now , '' 
`` Winky is pining , Harry Potter , '' 
`` Winky must not talk like that to Harry Potter ! '' 
`` Kreacher will not insult Harry Potter in front of Dobby , no he wo n't , or Dobby will shut Kreacher 's mouth for him ! '' 
`` Dobby is a free house-elf and he can obey anyone he likes and Dobby will do whatever Harry Potter wants him to do ! '' 
`` Yes , Harry Potter ! '' 
`` Master said he wanted regular reports on what the Malfoy boy is doing , so Kreacher has come to give -- '' 
`` Dobby has not slept for a week , Harry Potter ! '' 
`` Draco Malfoy is a bad boy ! '' 
`` Harry Potter , sir , '' 
`` the Malfoy boy is breaking no rules that Dobby can discover , but he is still keen to avoid detection . He has been making regular visits to the seventh floor with a variety of other students , who keep watch for him while he enters -- '' 
`` No , Harry Potter , that is impossible , '' 
`` Thank you , Harry Potter , sir ! '' 
`` Oh no , sir , '' 
`` Dobby has been taking some for Winky too , sir . '' 
`` She still does not care for clothes , Harry Potter . Nor do the other house-elves . None of them will clean Gryffindor Tower anymore , not with the hats and socks hidden everywhere , they finds them insulting , sir . Dobby does it all himself , sir , but Dobby does not mind , sir , for he always hopes to meet Harry Potter and tonight , sir , he has got his wish ! '' 
`` But Harry Potter does not seem happy , '' 
`` Because it is a room that a person can only enter , '' 
`` when they have real need of it . Sometimes it is there , and sometimes it is not , but when it appears , it is always equipped for the DUMBLEDORE 'S ARMY ` 387 ` seeker 's needs . Dobby has used it , sir , '' 
`` Dobby expects so , sir , '' 
`` Anytime , Harry Potter , sir , '' 
`` Okay , let 's go . ''
