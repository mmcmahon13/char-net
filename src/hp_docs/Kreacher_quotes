`` Master , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher . It was an honor , said Master Regulus , an honor for him and for Kreacher , who must be sure to do whatever the Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home . '' 
`` I know -- but how did you escape the Inferi ? '' 
`` The house-elf 's highest law is his Master 's bidding , '' 
`` You did n't disobey orders at all ! '' 
`` Master Regulus was very worried , very worried , '' 
`` M -- Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had , '' 
`` And he told Kreacher to take it and , when the basin was empty , to switch the lockets ... '' 
`` The Mudblood touched Kreacher , he will not allow it , what would his Mistress say ? '' 
`` Kreacher tried everything , everything he knew , but nothing , nothing would work ... So many powerful spells upon the casing , Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it , but it would not open ... Kreacher punished himself , he tried again , he punished himself , he tried again . Kreacher failed to obey orders , Kreacher could not destroy the locket ! And his mistress was mad with grief , because Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened , no , because Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave ... '' 
`` Do you think you could do that for us ? '' 
`` Sirius never cared about any of the junk -- '' 
`` Call ' im off , call ' im off , ' e should be locked up ! '' 
`` Thank you very much , Master , '' 
`` Shoes off , if you please , Master Harry , and hands washed before dinner , '' 
`` Fight ! Fight ! Fight for my Master , defender of the house-elves ! Fight the Dark Lord , in the name of brave Regulus ! Fight ! '' 
`` wo n't , wo n't , wo n't , '' 
`` Kreacher is showing a certain reluctance to pass into your ownership . '' 
`` Wo n't , wo n't , wo n't , WO N'T ! '' 
`` Kreacher will say what he likes about his master , oh yes , and what a master he is , filthy friend of Mudbloods , oh , what would poor Kreacher 's mistress say -- ? '' 
`` Master called me ? '' 
`` Kreacher will do whatever Master wants , '' 
`` because Kreacher has no choice , but Kreacher is ashamed to have such a master , yes -- '' 
`` Dobby will do it , Harry Potter ! '' 
`` Master wants me to follow the youngest of the Malfoys ? '' 
`` Master thinks of everything , and Kreacher must obey him even though Kreacher would much rather be the servant of the Malfoy boy , oh yes ... '' 
`` That 's settled , then , '' 
`` Night and day , '' 
`` Master Malfoy moves with a nobility that befits his pure blood , '' 
`` But Kreacher should know that Draco Malfoy is not a good master to a house-elf ! '' 
`` Let 's fast forward to where he 's actually been going . '' 
`` Master Malfoy eats in the Great Hall , he sleeps in a dormitory in the dungeons , he attends his classes in a variety of -- '' 
`` Dobby , you tell me , '' 
`` The Mudblood is speaking to Kreacher , Kreacher will pretend he can not hear -- '' 
`` Get out of it , ''
