`` Sorry ? '' 
`` Oh ! '' 
`` Well -- '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Well , ' bye , '' 
`` Cedric -- Cedric Diggory . '' 
`` Hello , Harry ! '' 
`` Yeah , I do , '' 
`` I 've supported them since I was six , '' 
`` The Tornado-hater ? '' 
`` Who told you I was ordering Dungbombs ? '' 
`` Now hand over whatever it is you 're sending . '' 
`` Because -- '' 
`` I saw him send it , '' 
`` No problem , '' 
`` I 'm going this way . Well , I 'll ... I 'll see you around , Harry . '' 
`` And that 's not to mention , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` nor with ours . '' 
`` It 's fantastic ! '' 
`` Harry 's leader , '' 
`` The Defense Association ? '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` You made me nervous , I was doing all right before then ! '' 
`` Do n't mind her , '' 
`` Well , they 've forbidden me to get on the wrong side of Umbridge too , '' 
`` Had a good Christmas ? '' 
`` Mine was pretty quiet , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` And Wood told you not to be a gentleman and knock me off my broom if you had to , '' 
`` Oh ... I do n't mind , '' 
`` It 's funny , is n't it , '' 
`` Um ... dâ€™you want to get a coffee ? '' 
`` Cute , is n't it ? '' 
`` Look , she 's decorated it for Valentine 's Day ! '' 
`` Two coffees , please , '' 
`` Oh ... well ... that was nice of her . '' 
`` I came in here with Cedric last year , '' 
`` Well -- no -- '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` Women ! '' 
`` What did she want to talk about Cedric for anyway ? Why does she always want to drag up a subject that makes her act like a human hosepipe ? '' 
`` Hi , Hagrid ! '' 
`` On the other hand , she rides a Comet Two Sixty , which is going to look like a joke next to the Firebolt . ''
