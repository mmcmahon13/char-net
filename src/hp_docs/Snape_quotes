`` Follow me , '' 
`` In ! '' 
`` So , '' 
`` the train is n't good enough for the famous Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick Weasley . Wanted to arrive with a bang , did we , boys ? '' 
`` Silence ! '' 
`` You were seen , '' 
`` Two Muggles in London , convinced they saw an old car flying over the Post Office tower ... at noon in Norfolk , Mrs. Hetty Bayliss , while hanging out her washing ... Mr. Angus Fleet , of Peebles , reported to police ... Six or seven Muggles in all . I be lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office ? '' 
`` Silence ! '' 
`` But I must impress upon both of you the seriousness of what you have done . I will be writing to both your families tonight . I must also warn you that if you do anything like this again , I will have no choice but to expel you . '' 
`` I must go back to the feast , Minerva , I 've got to give out a few notices . Come , Severus , there 's a delicious-looking cus tard tart I want to sample - '' 
`` If I might speak , Headmaster , '' 
`` Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time , '' 
`` But why not join the feast afterward ? '' 
`` Without any supper ? '' 
`` I suggest , Headmaster , that Potter is not being entirely truthful , '' 
`` I must have done it a hundred times . I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in my sleep - '' 
`` Excuse me , '' 
`` Expelliarmus ! '' 
`` That was a Disarming Charm - as you see , I 've lost my wand - ah , thank you , Miss Brown - yes , an excellent idea to show them that , Professor Snape , but if you do n't mind my saying * 190 * so , it was very obvious what you were about to do . If I had wanted to stop you it would have been only too easy - however , I felt it would be instructive to let them see ... '' 
`` Time to split up the dream team , I think , '' 
`` I do n't think so , '' 
`` Finite Incantatem ! '' 
`` How can you be sure ? '' 
`` Just the man , '' 
`` D-did I ? I do n't recall - '' 
`` I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you had n't had a crack at the monster before Hagrid was arrested , '' 
`` Well , at least we know exactly where Snape is now . '' 
`` Nobody ever goes in there . '' 
'' Dumbledore trusted Snape , '' 
`` Leave me now . '' 
`` Where are the Carrows ? '' 
`` I was under the impression , '' 
`` that Alecto had apprehended an intruder . '' 
`` And what gave you that impression ? '' 
`` You Death Eaters have you own private means of communication , I forgot . '' 
`` Really ? But all seems calm . '' 
`` Minerva ! '' 
`` P -- Peeves ? '' 
`` Let me find the boy . Let me bring you Potter . I know I can find him , my Lord . Please . '' 
`` My Lord ? '' 
`` My -- my lord ? '' 
'' James lifted an invisible sword . ``' Gryffindor , where dwell the brave at heart ! ' Like my dad . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` ... thought we were supposed to be friends ? '' 
`` Best friends ? '' 
`` That was nothing , '' 
`` What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to ? '' 
`` Every month at the full moon ? '' 
`` And you 're being really ungrateful . I heard what happened the other night . You went sneaking down that tunnel by the Whomping Willow , and James Potter saved you from whatever 's down there -- '' 
`` Saved ? Saved ? You think he was playing the hero ? He was saving his neck and his friends ' too ! You 're not going to -- I wo n't let you -- '' 
`` I did n't mean -- I just do n't want to see you made a fool of -- He fancies you , James Potter fancies you ! '' 
`` And he 's not ... everyone thinks ... big Quidditch hero -- '' 
`` It 's too late . I 've made excuses for you for years . None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you . You and your precious little Death Eater friends -- you see , you do n't even deny it ! You do n't even deny that 's what you 're all aiming to be ! You ca n't wait to join Voldemort , can you ? '' 
`` -- to call me Mudblood ? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood , Severus . Why should I be any different ? '' 
`` No -- no message -- I 'm here on my own account ! '' 
`` Everything -- everything I heard ! '' 
`` You do not care , then , about the deaths of her husband and child ? They can die , as long as you have what you want ? '' 
`` Hide them all , then , '' 
`` In -- in return ? '' 
`` Anything . '' 
`` Rather like you , Severus . Were n't you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her ? '' 
`` DO N'T ! '' 
`` If you loved Lily , if you truly loved her , then your way forward is clear . '' 
`` The Dark Lord will return , and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does . '' 
`` Very well . Very well . But never -- never tell , Dumbledore ! This must be between us ! Swear it ! I can not bear ... especially Potter 's son ... I want your word ! '' 
`` If you insist ... '' 
`` Karkaroff 's Mark is becoming darker too . He is panicking , he fears retribution ; you know how much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Why , '' 
`` why did you put on that ring ? It 575 carries a curse , surely you realized that . Why even touch it ? '' 
`` It is a miracle you managed to return here ! '' 
`` I can not tell . Maybe a year . There is no halting such a spell forever . It will spread eventually , it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time . '' 
`` If you had only summoned me a little earlier , I might have been able to do more , buy you more time ! '' 
`` Well , really , this makes matters much more straightforward . '' 
`` I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me . His plan to have the poor Malfoy boy murder me . '' 
`` The Dark Lord does not expect Draco Malfoy to succeed . This is merely punishment for Lucius 's recent failures . Slow torture for Draco 's parents , while they watch him fail and pay the price . '' 
`` All the same , try . I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever schemes might occur to the boy . Ultimately , of course , there is only one thing to be done if we are to save him from Lord Voldemort 's wrath . '' 
`` Are you intending to let him kill you ? '' 
`` Would you like me to do it now ? '' 
`` If you do n't mind dying , '' 
`` why not let Draco Malfoy do it ? '' 
`` I ask this one great favor of you , Severus , because death is coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year 's league . I confess I should prefer a quick , painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if , for instance , Greyback is involved -- I hear Voldemort has recruited him ? Or dear Bellatrix , who likes to play with her food before she eats it . '' 
`` Thank you , Severus ... '' 
`` What are you doing with Potter , all these evenings you are closeted together ? '' 
`` Information , '' 
`` You refuse to tell me everything , yet you expect that small service of me ! '' 
`` You gave me your word , Severus . And while we are talking about services 579 you owe me , I thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend ? '' 
`` For Nagini ? '' 
`` So the boy ... the boy must die ? '' 
`` I thought ... all those years ... that we were protecting him for her . For Lily . '' 
`` Lately , only those whom I could not save , '' 
`` For him ? '' 
`` Always , '' 
`` Not to do so will raise suspicion , when Voldemort believes you so well informed . However , you must plant the idea of decoys ; that , I think , ought to ensure Harry 's safety . Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher . And Severus , if you are forced to take part in the chase , be sure to act your part convincingly ... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord Voldemort 's good books as long as possible , or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the Carrows ... '' 
`` You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix , '' 
`` that they use decoys . Polyjuice Potion . Identical Potters . It 's the only thing that might work . You will forget that I have suggested this . You will present it as your own idea . You understand ? '' 
`` Sectumsempra ! '' 
`` Now , Severus , the sword ! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor -- and he must not know that you give it ! If Voldemort should read Harry 's mind and see you acting for him -- '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` And you still are n't going to tell me why it 's so important to give Potter the sword ? '' 
`` He will know what to do with it . And Severus , be very careful , they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley 's mishap -- '' 
`` Do n't worry , Dumbledore , '' 
`` I have a plan ... '' 
`` Moody . '' 
`` It 's no one 's fault but Potter 's , Karkaroff , '' 
`` -- and he hit Goyle -- look -- '' 
`` Hospital wing , Goyle , '' 
`` Let 's see , '' 
`` Antidotes ! '' 
`` You should all have prepared THE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS ` 301 ` your recipes now . I want you to brew them carefully , and then , we will be selecting someone on whom to test one ... '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` Please , sir , I 'm supposed to take Harry Potter upstairs . '' 
`` Potter has another hour of Potions to complete , '' 
`` Sir -- sir , Ludo Bagman wants him , '' 
`` Very well , very well , '' 
`` Very well ! '' 
`` It 's been getting clearer and clearer for months . I am becoming seriously concerned , I ca n't deny it -- '' 
`` Then flee , '' 
`` Flee -- I will make your excuses . I , however , am remaining at Hogwarts . '' 
`` Ten points from Ravenclaw , Fawcett ! '' 
`` And what are you two doing ? '' 
`` Keep walking , then ! '' 
`` I must ask you not to discuss it in my class . Ten points from Gryffindor . '' 
`` Ah ... reading magazines under the table as well ? '' 
`` A further ten points from Gryffindor ... oh but of course ... '' 
`` ` ... Harry Potter 's well-wishers must hope that , next time , he bestows his heart upon a worthier candidate . ' How very touching , '' 
`` All this press attention seems to have inflated your already overlarge head , Potter , '' 
`` You might be laboring under the delusion that the entire wizarding world is impressed with you , '' 
`` So I give you fair warning , Potter , '' 
`` pint-sized celebrity or not -- if I catch you breaking into my office one more time -- '' 
`` I have n't been anywhere near your office ! '' 
`` Do n't lie to me , '' 
`` You were out of bed on the night my office was broken into ! '' 
`` Severus , please fetch me the strongest Truth Potion you possess , and then go down to the kitchens and bring up the house-elf called Winky . Minerva , kindly go down to Hagrid 's house , where you will find a large black dog sitting in the pumpkin patch . Take the dog up to my office , tell him I will be with him shortly , then come back here . '' 
`` Crouch ! '' 
`` Step aside , please . Severus , you have the potion ? '' 
`` please tell Madam Pomfrey to come down here ; we need to get Mad-Eye Moody into the hospital wing . Then go down into the grounds , find Cornelius Fudge , and bring him up to this office . He will undoubtedly want D THE PARTING OF THE WAYS ` 693 ` to question Crouch himself . Tell him I will be in the hospital wing in half an hour 's time if he needs me . '' 
`` When we told Mr. Fudge that we had caught the Death Eater responsible for tonight 's events , '' 
`` he seemed to feel his personal safety was in question . He insisted on summoning a dementor to accompany him into the castle . He brought it up to the office where Barty Crouch -- '' 
`` I saw the Death Eaters ! I can give you their names ! Lucius -- '' 
`` There , '' 
`` It 's okay ! '' 
`` Him ! '' 
`` you know what I must ask you to do . If you are ready ... if you are prepared ... '' 
`` I am , '' 
`` I think you next wanted to know , '' 
`` Think ! '' 
`` I have played my part well , '' 
`` He wishes none to know of the plan . It is ... very secret . But -- '' 
`` If he has forbidden it , you ought not to speak , '' 
`` Even Snape says so : You were told not to talk , so hold your silence ! '' 
`` Certainly , '' 
`` That 's because he is sixteen and has no idea what lies in store ! Why , Severus ? Why my son ? It is too dangerous ! This is vengeance for Lucius 's mistake , I know it ! '' 
`` If Draco Malfoy succeeds , '' 
`` The Dark Lord will not be persuaded , and I am not stupid enough to attempt it , '' 
`` He does not mean him to succeed , he wants him to be killed trying ! '' 
`` He intends me to do it in the end , I think . But he is determined that Draco Malfoy should try first . You see , in the unlikely event that Draco succeeds , I shall be able to remain at Hogwarts a little longer , fulfilling my useful role as spy . '' 
`` The Dark Lord is very angry , '' 
`` The Unbreakable Vow ? '' 
`` Are n't you listening , Narcissa ? Oh , he 'll try , I 'm sure ... The usual empty words , the usual slithering out of action ... oh , on the Dark Lord 's orders , of course ! '' 
`` You will need your wand , Bellatrix , '' 
`` And you will need to move a little closer , '' 
`` I will , '' 
`` I will , '' 
`` I will , '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` Defense Against the Dark Arts , Charms , Transfiguration , Herbology ... '' 
`` All the subjects required , in short , for an Auror , '' 
`` I 'd like a word with you , Draco , '' 
`` Follow me , Draco . '' 
`` For the last time , I did n't do it , okay ? That Bell girl must 've had an enemy no one knows about -- do n't look at me like that ! I know what you 're doing , I 'm not stupid , but it wo n't work -- I can stop you ! '' 
`` Ah ... Aunt Bellatrix has been teaching you Occlumency , I see . What thoughts are you trying to conceal from your master , Draco ? '' 
`` You know perfectly well that I do not wish to do either of those things . '' 
`` Listen to me , '' 
`` Keep your voice down ! '' 
`` It is an act that is crucial to success , Draco ! '' 
`` I know what you 're up to ! You want to steal my glory ! '' 
`` You are speaking like a child . I quite understand that your father 's capture and imprisonment has upset you , but -- '' 
`` Late again , Potter , '' 
`` Before we start , I want your dementor essays , '' 
`` No , there was n't , '' 
`` Should n't he be upset Mundungus has been arrest -- '' 
`` But Potter seems to have a lot to say on the subject , '' 
`` Oh , very good , '' 
`` A five-year-old could have told us as much , '' 
`` When we come face-to-face with one down a dark alley , we 're going to be having a shufti to see if it 's solid , are n't we , we 're not going to be asking , ` Excuse me , are you the imprint of a departed soul ? ' '' 
`` Another ten points from Gryffindor , '' 
`` Now open your books to page two hundred and thirteen , '' 
`` and read the first two paragraphs on the Cruciatus Curse ... '' 
`` and he found the place where you were all fighting ... '' 
`` We were in trouble , we were losing , '' 
`` Settle down , '' 
`` Before we begin today 's lesson , '' 
`` I think it appropriate to remind you that next June you will be sitting an important examination , during which you will prove how much you have learned about the composition and use of magical potions . Moronic though some of this class undoubtedly are , I expect you to scrape an ` Acceptable ' in your O.W.L. , or suffer my ... displeasure . '' 
`` After this year , of course , many of you will cease studying with me , '' 
`` But we have another year to go before that happy moment of farewell , '' 
`` I have awarded you the grades you would have received if you presented this work in your O.W.L , '' 
`` This should give you a realistic idea of what to expect in your examination . '' 
`` The general standard of this homework was abysmal . Most of you would have failed had this been your examination . I expect to see a great deal more effort for this week 's essay on the various varieties of venom antidotes , or I shall have to start handing out detentions to those dunces who get D 's . '' 
`` Not ... funny ... do n't ... Mungo 's ... show ... him ... '' 
`` Fighting , Potter , Weasley , Longbottom ? '' 
`` You will notice , '' 
`` that we have a guest with us today . '' 
`` We are continuing with our Strengthening Solutions today , you will find your mixtures as you left them last lesson , if correctly made they should have matured well over the weekend -- instructions '' 
`` on the board . Carry on . '' 
`` Though I would question whether it is advisable to teach them a potion like the Strengthening Solution . I think the Ministry would prefer it if that was removed from the syllabus . '' 
`` Fourteen years , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` But you were unsuccessful ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I suggest you ask him , '' 
`` I suppose this is relevant ? '' 
`` No marks again , then , Potter , '' 
`` Maybe I 'll skive off Divination , '' 
`` Because the headmaster thinks it a good idea , '' 
`` Who 's going to be teaching me ? '' 
`` I am , '' 
`` I suppose because it is a headmaster 's privilege to delegate less enjoyable tasks , '' 
`` I assure you I did not beg for the job . '' 
`` I will expect you at six o’clock on Monday evening , Potter . My office . If anybody asks , you are taking Remedial Potions . Nobody who has seen you in my classes could deny you need them . '' 
`` How touching , '' 
`` Well then , you 'll know he 's so arrogant that criticism simply bounces off him , '' 
`` I do n't care if Dumbledore thinks you 've reformed , I know better -- '' 
`` Oh , but why do n't you tell him so ? '' 
`` Speaking of dogs , '' 
`` did you know that Lucius recognized you last time you risked a little jaunt outside ? Clever idea , Black , getting yourself seen on a safe station platform ... gave you a cast-iron excuse not to leave your hidey-hole in future , did n't it ? '' 
`` Why , yes , I suppose I am , '' 
`` Six o’clock Monday evening , Potter . '' 
`` This may not be an ordinary class , Potter , '' 
`` but I am still your teacher and you will therefore call me ` sir ' or ` Professor ' at all times . '' 
`` Surely even you could have worked that out by now , Potter ? The Dark Lord is highly skilled at Legilimency -- '' 
`` You have no subtlety , Potter , '' 
`` You do not understand fine distinctions . It is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion-maker . '' 
`` It is true , however , that those who have mastered Legilimency are able , un - OCCLUMENCY ` 531 ` der certain conditions , to delve into the minds of their victims and to interpret their findings correctly . The Dark Lord , for instance , almost always knows when somebody is lying to him . Only those skilled at Occlumency are able to shut down those feelings and memories that contradict the lie , and so utter falsehoods in his presence without detection . '' 
`` The Dark Lord is at a considerable distance and the walls and grounds of Hogwarts are guarded by many ancient spells and charms to ensure the bodily and mental safety of those who dwell within them , '' 
`` Well then , why do I have to learn Occlumency ? '' 
`` I do n't like it much , but it 's been useful , has n't it ? I mean ... I saw that snake attack Mr. Weasley and if I had n't , Professor Dumbledore would n't have been able to save him , would he ? Sir ? '' 
`` Do not interrupt me , Potter , '' 
`` Do not say the Dark Lord 's name ! '' 
`` Dumbledore is an extremely powerful wizard , '' 
`` While he may feel secure enough to use the name ... the rest of us ... '' 
`` It seems so , '' 
`` I told you , '' 
`` to call me ` sir . ' '' 
`` It is enough that we know , '' 
`` Sir ? '' 
`` He might , '' 
`` Which brings us back to Occlumency . '' 
`` You may use your wand to attempt to disarm me , or defend yourself in any other way you can think of , '' 
`` I am about to attempt to break into your mind , '' 
`` We are going to see how well you resist . I have been told that you have already shown aptitude at resisting the Imperius Curse ... You will find that similar powers are needed for this ... Brace yourself , now ... Legilimens ! '' 
`` Did you mean to produce a Stinging Hex ? '' 
`` I thought not , '' 
`` Flashes of it , '' 
`` Well , for a first attempt that was not as poor as it might have been , '' 
`` Manners , Potter , '' 
`` Clear your mind , Potter , '' 
`` You 're not doing it , Potter ... You will need more discipline than this ... Focus , now ... '' 
`` Get up ! '' 
`` Then you will find yourself easy prey for the Dark Lord ! '' 
`` Then prove it ! Master yourself ! '' 
`` Control your anger , discipline your mind ! We shall try again ! Get ready , now ! Legilimens ! '' 
`` What happened then , Potter ? '' 
`` Realized what ? '' 
`` What did you say ? '' 
`` And why , '' 
`` would you ask such a thing ? '' 
`` that corridor I 've just seen -- I 've been dreaming about it for months -- I 've just recognized it -- it leads to the Department of Mysteries ... and I think Voldemort wants something from -- '' 
`` I have told you not to say the Dark Lord 's name ! '' 
`` And if we ca n't trust Dumbledore , we ca n't trust anyone . '' 
`` That last memory , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` How do that man and that room come to be inside your head , Potter ? '' 
`` A dream , '' 
`` You do know why we are here , do n't you , Potter ? '' 
`` Perhaps , '' 
`` perhaps you actually enjoy having these visions and dreams , Potter . Maybe they make you feel special -- important ? '' 
`` That is just as well , Potter , '' 
`` because you are neither special nor important , and it is not up to you to find out what the Dark Lord is saying to his Death Eaters . '' 
`` Yes , Potter , '' 
`` That is my job . Now , if you are ready , we will start again ... '' 
`` Protego ! '' 
`` Reparo ! '' 
`` Well , Potter ... that was certainly an improvement ... '' 
`` Legilimens ! '' 
`` You are not working hard enough ! '' 
`` Why do you call Voldemort the Dark Lord , I 've only ever heard Death Eaters call him that -- '' 
`` What the -- ? '' 
`` You wanted to see me , Headmistress ? '' 
`` You took my last bottle to interrogate Potter , '' 
`` Certainly , '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` I wish to interrogate him ! '' 
`` I have already told you , '' 
`` that I have no further stocks of Veritaserum . Unless you wish to poison Potter -- and I assure you I would have the greatest sympathy with you if you did -- I can not help you . The only trouble is that most venoms act too fast to give the victim much time for truth-telling ... '' 
`` You are being deliberately unhelpful ! I expected better , Lucius always speaks most highly of you ! Now get out of my office ! '' 
`` He 's got Padfoot at the place where it 's hidden ! '' 
`` What is Padfoot ? Where what is hidden ? What does he mean , Snape ? '' 
`` I have no idea , '' 
`` Potter , when I want nonsense shouted at me I shall give you a Babbling Beverage . And Crabbe , loosen your hold a little , if Longbottom suffocates it will mean a lot of tedious paperwork , and I am afraid I shall have to mention it on your reference if ever you apply for a job . '' 
`` What are you doing , Potter ? '' 
`` Ten points from Gryff -- '' 
`` Professor Minerva McGonagall ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` settle down '' 
`` Now , '' 
`` Potter , you can skin Malfoy 's shrivelfig , '' 
`` Orange , Longbottom , '' 
`` Longbottom , at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion to your toad and see what happens . Perhaps that will encourage you to do it properly . '' 
`` You should have finished adding your ingredients by now ; this potion needs to stew before it can be drunk , so clear away while it simmers and then we 'll test Longbottom 's ... '' 
`` Five points from Gryffindor , '' 
`` Not at all , '' 
`` Headmaster ? '' 
`` Have you any theory as to how he got in , Professor ? '' 
`` You remember the conversation we had , Headmaster , just before -- ah -- the start of term ? '' 
`` Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the werewolf and the true wolf ? '' 
`` Anyone ? '' 
`` That is the second time you have spoken out of turn , Miss Granger , '' 
`` Detention , Weasley , '' 
`` Very poorly explained ... That is incorrect , the kappa is more commonly found in Mongolia ... Professor Lupin gave this eight out of ten ? I would n't have given it three ... '' 
`` How extraordinarily like your father you are , Potter , '' 
`` And neither do I. '' 
`` Your father did n't set much store by rules either , '' 
`` Have you been imagining some act of glorious heroism ? Then let me correct you -- your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing joke on me that would have resulted in my death if your father had n't got cold feet at the last moment . There was nothing brave about what he did . He was saving his own skin as much as mine . Had their joke succeeded , he would have been expelled from Hogwarts . '' 
`` Turn out your pockets , Potter ! '' 
`` Indeed ? And you 've been carrying them around ever since ? How very touching ... and what is this ? '' 
`` So ! '' 
`` Show yourself ! '' 
`` Professor Severus Snape , master of this school , commands you to yield the information you conceal ! '' 
'' said Hermione . Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-eyed witch . '' 
`` I found this at the base of the Whomping Willow , '' 
`` Very useful , Potter , I thank you ... '' 
`` You 're wondering , perhaps , how I knew you were here ? '' 
`` You have n't heard everything -- I can explain -- Sirius is not here to kill Harry -- '' 
`` Two more for Azkaban tonight , '' 
`` Give me a reason , '' 
`` Professor Snape -- it it would n't hurt to hear what they 've got to say , w -- would it ? '' 
`` Miss Granger , you are already facing suspension from this school , '' 
`` But if -- if there was a mistake -- '' 
`` KEEP QUIET , YOU STUPID GIRL ! '' 
`` Vengeance is very sweet , '' 
`` You - you 've got to hear me out , '' 
`` The rat -- look at the rat -- '' 
`` Come on , all of you , '' 
`` Get out of the way , Potter , you 're in enough trouble already , '' 
`` Do n't ask me to fathom the way a werewolf 's mind works , '' 
`` SILENCE ! I WILL NOT BE SPOKEN TO LIKE THAT ! '' 
`` Expelliarmus ! '' 
`` I suppose he 's told you the same fairy tale he 's planted in Potter 's mind ? '' 
`` And does my evidence count for nothing ? '' 
`` He must have Disapparated , Severus . We should have left somebody in the room with him . When this gets out -- '' 
`` HE DID N'T DISAPPARATE ! '' 
`` OUT WITH IT , POTTER ! '' 
`` This door 's been locked , we just saw -- '' 
`` THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE , I KNOW IT ! '' 
`` YOU DO N'T KNOW POTTER ! '' 
`` Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be in two places at once , I 'm afraid I do n't see any point in troubling them further . '' 
`` You 're lucky you were n't killed . Why are n't you in your dormitory ? '' 
`` Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , '' 
`` The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n't be far , we 'll catch them . '' 
'' Snape spat bitterly on the ground . Harry left the locker room alone some time later , to take his Nimbus Two Thousand back to the broomshed . He could n't ever remember feeling happier . He 'd really done something to be proud of now -- no one could say he was just a famous name any more . The evening air had never smelled so sweet . He walked over the damp grass , reliving the last hour in his head , which was a happy blur : Gryffindors running to lift him onto their shoulders ; Ron and Hermione in the distance , jumping up and down , Ron cheering through a heavy nosebleed . Harry had reached the shed . He leaned against the wooden door and looked up at Hogwarts , with its windows glowing red in the setting sun . Gryffindor in the lead . He 'd done it , he 'd shown Snape ... And speaking of Snape ... A hooded figure came swiftly down the front steps of the castle . Clearly not wanting to be seen , it walked as fast as possible toward the forbidden forest . Harry 's victory faded from his mind as he watched . He recognized the figure 's prowling walk . Snape , sneaking into the forest while everyone else was at dinner -- what was going on ? Harry jumped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off . Gliding silently over the castle he saw Snape enter the forest at a run . He followed . The trees were so thick he could n't see where Snape had gone . He flew in circles , lower and lower , brushing the top branches of trees until he heard voices . He glided toward them and landed noiselessly in a towering beech tree . He climbed carefully along one of the branches , holding tight to his broomstick , trying to see through the leaves . Below , in a shadowy clearing , stood Snape , but he was n't alone . Quirrell was there , too . Harry could n't make out the look on his face , but he was stuttering worse than ever . Harry strained to catch what they were saying . '' 
'' -- your little bit of hocus-pocus . I 'm waiting . '' 
`` B-but I d-d-don ' t -- '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` We 'll have another little chat soon , when you 've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . ''
