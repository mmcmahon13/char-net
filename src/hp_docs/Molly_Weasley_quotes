`` Have you any idea how worried I 've been ? '' 
`` Sorry , Mum , but see , we had to - '' 
`` YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF PERCY 'S BOOK ! '' 
`` You could have died , you could have been seen , you could have lost your father his job - '' 
`` I 'm very pleased to see you , Harry , dear , '' 
`` Come in and have some breakfast . '' 
`` do n't know what you were thinking of , '' 
`` never would have believed it . '' 
`` I do n't blame you , dear , '' 
`` Arthur and I have been worried about you , too . Just last night we were saying we 'd come and get you ourselves if you had n't written back to Ron by Friday . But really , '' 
`` flying an illegal car halfway across the country - anyone could have seen you - '' 
`` You keep your mouth closed while you 're eating ! '' 
`` And you ! '' 
`` I think I 'll go to bed and - '' 
`` You will not , '' 
`` It 's your own fault you 've been up all night . You 're going to de-gnome the garden for me ; they 're getting completely out of hand again - '' 
`` Oh , Mum - '' 
`` And you two , '' 
`` You can go up to bed , dear , '' 
`` That 's very sweet of you , dear , but it 's dull work , '' 
`` Now , let 's see what Lockhart 's got to say on the subject - '' 
`` Oh , he is marvelous , '' 
`` Do n't be so ridiculous , Fred , '' 
`` Well , that fits in nicely , we can go and get all your things then , too , '' 
`` Dudley would think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney , do n't worry about that - '' 
`` Well ... all right ... you go after Arthur , '' 
`` Oh , there you are , good , '' 
`` Harry ? You are the real Harry ? What happened ? Where are the others ? '' 
`` Fer medicinal purposes ? '' 
`` if they made it , George and Lupin ought to be back in about a minute . '' 
`` Where 's Hedwig , Harry ? '' 
`` Yes , good point , '' 
`` I 'm so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering , '' 
`` Oh , it 's been nothing , nothing '' 
`` Enchant Â´ ee , '' 
'' Your ' usband ' as been telling us such amusing stories ! '' 
`` Well , com in , do ! '' 
`` No , please ! '' 
`` Oh , good , you 've fed the chickens , '' 
`` We 'd better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding , '' 
`` Oh , do n't be silly , dear ! '' 
`` Not at all , not at all ... It 's no trouble ... '' 
`` Wish Dad would hurry up and get here . Mum 's getting edgy . '' 
`` I think we 'd better start without Arthur , '' 
`` -- raised voices , '' 
`` He 's gone ! '' 
`` Harry , dear , everyone 's awfully hungry , we did n't like to start without you ... Shall I serve dinner now ? '' 
`` You 're underage ! '' 
`` She 's sixteen ! '' 
`` Ginny ! '' 
`` NOT MY DAUGHTER , YOU BITCH ! '' 
`` OUT OF MY WAY ! '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` You -- will -- never -- touch -- our -- children -- again ! '' 
`` Oh thank goodness , thank goodness ! '' 
`` Arthur -- I 've been so worried -- so worried -- '' 
`` You 're all right , '' 
`` Ouch ! Mum -- you 're strangling us -- '' 
`` I shouted at you before you left ! '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` Hedwig , dear ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` They want compensation for their ruined property . Mundungus Fletcher 's put in a claim for a twelve-bedroomed tent with en-suite Jacuzzi , but I 've got his number . I know for a fact he was sleeping under a cloak propped on sticks . '' 
`` Your father has n't had to go into the office on weekends since the days of Voldemort , '' 
`` Do n't you dare blame your father for what that wretched Skeeter woman wrote ! '' 
`` Well , it is a bit long , dear , '' 
`` What are you two up to ? '' 
`` Do n't be ridiculous , you 're still on holiday , '' 
`` You 're not by any chance writing out a new order form , are you ? '' 
`` Oh your father 's coming ! '' 
`` Coming , Arthur ! '' 
`` I think you 'd all better go upstairs and check that you 've packed properly ! '' 
`` Here you are , '' 
`` Of course I have n't , '' 
`` Dress robes ! '' 
`` Everyone wears them , Ron ! '' 
`` Do n't be so silly , '' 
`` I thought they 'd bring out the color of your eyes , dear , '' 
`` Because ... well , I had to get yours secondhand , and there was n't a lot of choice ! '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Go naked . And , Harry , make sure you get a picture of him . Goodness knows I could do with a laugh . '' 
`` Arthur ! '' 
`` I 've got a quill here somewhere ! '' 
`` Here ! '' 
`` bothering you so early and everything ... but Arthur 's the only one who can get Mad-Eye off , and Mad-Eye 's supposed to be starting his new job today . Why he had to choose last night ... '' 
`` Never mind , Amos , '' 
`` Harry ! Oh Harry ! '' 
`` Just tired . '' 
`` You 'll need to drink all of this , Harry , '' 
`` That 's Fudge 's voice , '' 
`` He 's not here , '' 
`` Of course you can , '' 
`` Sirius Black ! '' 
`` You 've got to take the rest of your potion , Harry , '' 
`` It was n't your fault , Harry , '' 
`` Your potion , Harry , '' 
`` You 're like Ron , '' 
`` Oh yes , she arrived the day before yesterday , '' 
`` Everyone 's in bed , of course , we did n't expect you for hours . Here you are -- '' 
`` Thanks , Molly Weasley . '' 
`` He taught Arthur and me , '' 
`` I know what you mean , '' 
`` Of course he can be charming when he wants to be , but Arthur 's never liked him much . The Ministry 's littered with Slughorn 's old favorites , he was always good at giving leg ups , but he never had much time for Arthur -- did n't seem to think he was enough of a highflier . Well , that just shows you , even Slughorn makes mistakes . I do n't know whether Ron 's told you in any of his letters -- it 's only just happened -- but Arthur 's been promoted ! '' 
`` You are sweet , '' 
`` Well , you see , in all the panic about Voldemort , odd things have been cropping up for sale everywhere , things that are supposed to guard against Voldemort and the Death Eaters . You can imagine the kind of thing -- so-called protective potions that are really gravy with a bit of bubotuber pus added , or instruc - AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM ` 85 ` tions for defensive jinxes that actually make your ears fall off ... Well , in the main the perpetrators are just people like Mundungus Fletcher , who 've never done an honest day 's work in their lives and are taking advantage of how frightened everybody is , but every now and then something really nasty turns up . The other day Arthur confiscated a box of cursed Sneakoscopes that were almost certainly planted by a Death Eater . So you see , it 's a very important job , and I tell him it 's just silly to miss dealing with spark plugs and toasters and all the rest of that Muggle rubbish . '' 
`` Yes , he is . As a matter of fact , he 's a tiny bit late ... He said he 'd be back around midnight ... '' 
`` It 's been like that for a while now , '' 
`` ever since Voldemort came back into the open . I suppose everybody 's in mortal danger now ... I do n't think it can be just our family ... but I do n't know anyone else who 's got a clock like this , so I ca n't check . Oh ! '' 
`` Arthur , is that you ? '' 
`` To find out how airplanes stay up . '' 
`` Mollywobbles , '' 
`` Now you can let me in . '' 
`` I still do n't see why we have to go through that every time you come home , '' 
`` It sounds like the sort of thing Fred and George would find funny , '' 
`` Bed , '' 
`` Oh , they 're in Diagon Alley , sleeping in the little flat over their CHAPTER FIVE ` 88 ` joke shop as they 're so busy , '' 
`` We had n't got around to telling him yet . '' 
`` tchah ! '' 
`` I do not hate her ! '' 
`` Yes , well , your father and I were made for each other , what was the point in waiting ? '' 
`` Stop calling her that , Ginny , '' 
`` Well , I 'd better get on ... Eat your eggs while they 're warm , Harry . '' 
`` Ginny , '' 
`` come downstairs and help me with the lunch . '' 
`` Now ! '' 
`` It just wo n't budge , '' 
`` Yes , dear , I 'd have noticed , '' 
`` Well done ! '' 
`` Yes , well , '' 
`` perhaps we should talk about something diff -- '' 
`` Did you hear about Florean Fortescue , Remus ? '' 
`` Harry , this is so cool , you 're my Captain -- if you let me back on the team , I suppose , ha ha ... '' 
`` Well , I do n't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you 've got these , '' 
`` Then you just buck up your ideas , young man , before I decide you 're too immature to come with us ! '' 
`` mortal peril , '' 
`` Yes , but do n't go arresting anyone now , dear , we 're in a hurry , '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Everyone all right ? '' 
`` We really have n't got too long , '' 
`` They 'll be murdered in their beds ! '' 
`` If I see you do that again I 'll jinx your fingers together , '' 
`` A what ? '' 
`` Look , they 're so sweet ... '' 
`` Ah , Harry ! '' 
`` A big mistake if you ask -- '' 
`` Yes , thank you , '' 
`` Quick , quick , through the barrier , '' 
`` Harry had better go first , with -- '' 
`` You 'd better get straight on the train , all of you , you 've only got a few minutes to go , '' 
`` Harry , quickly ! '' 
`` Now , dear , you 're coming to us for Christmas , it 's all fixed with Dumbledore , so we 'll see you quite soon , '' 
`` -- be good and -- '' 
`` Dumbledore 's told us how you saved him with the bezoar , '' 
`` I am so sorry -- '' 
`` Bill , '' 
`` It is an odd case , possibly unique ... We do n't know what his behavior might be like when he awakens ... '' 
`` What do you mean , ` ' e was going to be married ? ' '' 
`` Well , yes , I 'm sure , '' 
`` but I thought perhaps -- given how -- how he -- '' 
`` You thought I would not weesh to marry him ? Or per ' aps , you hoped ? '' 
`` What do I care how he looks ? I am good-looking enough for both of us , I theenk ! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave ! And I shall do zat ! '' 
`` Our Great-Auntie Muriel , '' 
`` has a very beautiful tiara -- goblin-made -- which I am sure I could persuade her to lend you for the wedding . She is very fond of Bill , you know , and it would look lovely with your hair . '' 
`` Oh , Harry , it 's lovely to see you ! '' 
`` You 're looking peaky ; you need feeding up , but you 'll have to wait a bit for dinner , I 'm afraid ... '' 
`` Ron and Hermione will explain everything , dear , I 've really got to dash , '' 
`` you 're the door on the right . I 'll call you when it 's over . '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` I thought it might have been Kreacher , he keeps doing odd things like that . Now do n't forget to keep your voices down in the hall . Ginny , your hands are filthy , what have you been doing ? Go and wash them before dinner , please ... '' 
`` We 're eating down in the kitchen , '' 
`` Tonks ! '' 
`` Yoooou ! '' 
`` Yes , is n't it ? '' 
`` Healer Smethwyck worked his magic in the end , found an antidote to whatever that snake 's got in its fangs , and Arthur 's learned his lesson about dabbling in Muggle medicine , have n't you , dear ? '' 
`` Good-bye , Harry , take care , '' 
`` Black 's not going to be caught by a thirteen-year-old wizard . It 's the Azkaban guards who 'll get him back , You mark my words . '' 
`` That 's enough , now , '' 
`` How really corking to see you -- '' 
`` I said , that 's enough , '' 
`` Hello , Harry , dear . I suppose you 've heard our exciting news ? '' 
`` Second Head Boy in the family ! '' 
`` Arthur , the truth would terrify him ! '' 
`` You know what Harry and Ron are like , wandering off by themselves -- they 've ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice ! But Harry must n't do that this year ! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home ! If the Knight Bus had n't picked him up , I 'm prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him . '' 
`` Busy year ? '' 
`` You must be Harry 's family ! ''
