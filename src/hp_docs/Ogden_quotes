`` Now , look -- '' 
`` Correct ! '' 
`` Yes , he did ! '' 
`` Defend himself against what , man ? '' 
`` Busybodies . Intruders . Muggles and filth . '' 
`` It 's your son I 'm here to see , Mr. Gaunt , '' 
`` That 's neither here nor there , '' 
`` Now I come to think about it , I 've seen noses like yours down in the village . ''

`` Then you can hardly complain that you get no warning of visitors , '' 
`` Mâ€™daughter , Merope , '' 
`` Good morning , '' 
`` Well , Mr. Gaunt , '' 
`` to get straight to the point , we have reason to believe that your son , Morfin , performed magic in front of a Muggle late last night . '' 
`` Mr. Gaunt , please ! '' 
`` Reparo . '' 
`` Mr. Gaunt , '' 
`` as I 've said : the reason for my visit -- '' 
`` I heard you the first time ! '' 
`` Morfin has broken Wizarding law , '' 
`` ` Morfin has broken Wizarding law . ' ''
