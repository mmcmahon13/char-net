`` If you ca n't control that owl , it 'll have to go ! '' 
`` She 's bored , '' 
`` And you , boy ? '' 
`` I 'll be in my room , making no noise and pretending I 'm not there , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Well done , '' 
`` Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school , '' 
`` Why 're you staring at the hedge ? '' 
'' I , m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on fire , '' 
`` Jiggery pokery ! '' 
`` MUUUUM ! He 's doing you know what ! '' 
`` Get in here ! And walk on the newspaper ! '' 
`` Upstairs ! Hurry ! '' 
`` Remember , boy - one sound - '' 
`` Er - hello , '' 
`` So long has Dobby wanted to meet you , sir ... Such an honor it is ... '' 
`` Th-thank you , '' 
`` What are you ? '' 
`` Who are you ? '' 
`` Oh - really ? '' 
`` Not that I 'm not pleased to meet you , '' 
`` but , er , is there any particular reason you 're here ? '' 
`` Dobby has come to tell you , sir ... it is difficult , sir ... Dobby wonders where to begin ... '' 
`` Sit down , '' 
`` S-sit down ! '' 
`` Never ... never ever ... '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` I did n't mean to offend you or anything - '' 
`` Offend Dobby ! '' 
`` Dobby has never been asked to sit down by a wizard - like an equal - '' 
`` Shh ! '' 
`` You ca n't have met many decent wizards , '' 
`` Bad Dobby ! Bad Dobby ! '' 
`` Do n't - what are you doing ? '' 
`` A house-elf must be set free , sir . And the family will never set Dobby free ... Dobby will serve the family until he dies , sir ... '' 
`` And I thought I had it bad staying here for another four weeks , '' 
`` This makes the Dursleys sound almost human . Ca n't anyone help you ? Ca n't I ? '' 
`` Please , '' 
`` please be quiet . If the Dursleys hear anything , if they know you 're here - '' 
`` that Harry Potter met the Dark Lord for a second time just weeks ago ... that Harry Potter escaped Yet again . '' 
`` Well then , I ca n't think who else would have a chance of making horrible things happen at Hogwarts , '' 
`` Quick ! In the closet ! '' 
`` You 've just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke ... One more sound and you 'll wish you 'd never been born , boy ! '' 
`` I expect they 've just been - wait a minute , '' 
`` Go on - read it ! '' 
`` Ron , how did you - What the - ? '' 
`` You know we 're not supposed to do spells outside school - '' 
`` You should talk , '' 
`` If the Dursleys wake up , I 'm dead , '' 
`` Watch out for the bottom stair - it creaks , '' 
`` One good push - '' 
`` I 've forgotten Hedwig ! '' 
`` Put your foot down , Fred ! '' 
`` See you next summer ! '' 
`` Let Hedwig out , '' 
`` What 's been happening ? '' 
`` I do n't think he could , '' 
`` I told you , every time he got close to letting something slip , he started banging his head against the wall . '' 
`` What , you think he was lying to me ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Draco Malfoy , '' 
`` Must be , it 's not a very common name , is it ? '' 
`` Lucius came back saying he 'd never meant any of it . Load of dung - Dad reckons he was right in You - Know-Who 's inner circle . '' 
`` Witching Hour , with the popular singing sorceress , Celestina Warbeck . '' 
`` You did n't ask them to fly that wretched car - '' 
`` I 'll help Ron . I 've never seen a de-gnoming - '' 
`` Mum , we know how to de-gnome a garden - '' 
`` Muggles have garden gnomes , too , you know , '' 
`` I bet I can get mine beyond that stump . '' 
`` You do n't know how weird it is for her to be this shy . She never shuts up normally - '' 
`` Your Quidditch team ? '' 
`` You 've been told to get all Lockhart 's books , too ! '' 
'' ` I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that you did n't do anything illegal to get him out , Ron , because that would get Harry into trouble , too . I 've been really worried and if Harry is all right , will you please let me know at once , but perhaps it would be bet ter if you used a different owl because I think another delivery might finish your one off . '' 
`` What 're you all up to today ? '' 
`` The right what ? '' 
`` They would n't mind , '' 
`` I 'm fine , thanks , '' 
`` HARRY ! What d'yeh think yer doin ' down there ? '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Skulkin ' around Knockturn Alley , I dunno dodgy place , Harry - don ' want no one ter see yeh down there - '' 
`` I realized that , '' 
`` I 'm staying with the Weasleys but we got separated , '' 
`` Harry ! Harry ! Over here ! '' 
`` As soon as I 've found the Weasleys , '' 
`` that he would shortly be getting much , much more than my book , Magical Me . He and his schoolmates will , in fact , be getting the real magical me . Yes , ladies and gentlemen , I have great pleasure and pride in announcing that this September , I will be taking up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ! '' 
`` You have these , '' 
`` Bet you loved that , did n't you , Potter ? '' 
`` Hey - Harry - come and look - it 's the Sorting ! '' 
`` Hang on ... '' 
`` I mean , everyone hates him - '' 
`` Or maybe , '' 
`` he 's waiting to hear why you two did n't arrive on the school train . '' 
`` Dear , dear ... his own son ... '' 
`` Most unfortunately , you are not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with me . I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power . You will wait here . '' 
`` Professor , when we took the car , term had n't started , so - so Gryffindor should n't really have points taken from it - should it ? '' 
`` But you will both get a de tention . '' 
`` So did I , '' 
`` Why could n't we get through the barrier ? '' 
`` We 'll have to watch our step from now on , though , '' 
`` Inspired ! What an entrance ! Flying a car right into the Whomping Willow , people 'll be talking about that one for years - '' 
`` Good for you , '' 
`` I know , I know - it 's not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly 's Most Charming-Smile Award five times in a row , as I have - but it 's a start , Harry , it 's a start . '' 
`` When it is safe to remove them , I will give you the thumbs-up . Right - earmuffs on . '' 
`` As our Mandrakes are only seedlings , their cries wo n't kill yet , '' 
`` Stupid - useless - thing - '' 
`` Write home for another one , '' 
`` What 've we got this afternoon ? '' 
`` All right , Harry ? I 'm - I 'm Colin Creevey , '' 
`` I 'm in Gryffindor , too . D'you think - would it be all right if - can I have a picture ? '' 
`` I know all about you . Everyone 's told me . About how you survived when Voldemort tried to kill you and how he disappeared and everything and how you 've still got a lightning scar on your forehead '' 
`` and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right potion , the pictures 'll move . '' 
`` maybe your friend could take it and I could stand next to you ? And then , could you sign it ? '' 
`` No , I 'm not , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Sorry , Colin , I 'm in a hurry - Quidditch practice - '' 
`` It 'll be really boring , '' 
`` You must be brilliant . I 've never flown . Is it easy ? Is that your own broom ? Is that the best one there is ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` And the fourth ball - '' 
'' - is the Golden Snitch , '' 
`` and it 's very small , very fast , and difficult to catch . But that 's what the Seeker 's got to do , because a game of Quidditch does n't end until the Snitch has been caught . And whichever team 's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` We 'd better get him to Hagrid 's , it 's nearest , '' 
`` Get out of the way , Colin ! '' 
`` Quick , behind here , '' 
`` Bin wonderin ' when you 'd come ter see me - come in , come in - thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again - '' 
`` What did Lockhart want with you , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Bu ' maybe it was a good thing yer wand backfired . ` Spect Lucius would 've come marchin ' up ter school if yeh 'd cursed his son . Least yer not in trouble . '' 
`` Got ta bone ter pick with yeh . I 've heard you 've bin givin ' out signed photos . How come I have n't got one ? '' 
`` I have not been giving out signed photos , '' 
`` If Lockhart 's still spreading that around - '' 
`` I 'm on ' y jokin ' , '' 
`` Bet he did n't like that , '' 
`` An ' then I told him Id never read one o ' his books an ' he decided ter go . Treacle fudge , Ron ? '' 
`` What 've you been feeding them ? '' 
`` Well , I 've bin givin ' them - you know - a bit o ' help - '' 
`` Said she was jus ' lookin ' round the grounds , but I reckon she was hopin ' she might run inter someone else at my house . '' 
`` If yeh ask me , she wouldn ' say no ter a signed - '' 
`` Oh , shut up , '' 
`` Oh n - Professor , ca n't I go and do the trophy room , too ? '' 
`` Professor Lockhart requested you particularly . Eight o'clock sharp , both of you . '' 
`` I 'd swap anytime , '' 
'' .138 Harry strained his ears . Distantly , from the floor above , and growing fainter still , he heard the voice : '' 
`` Ask him ! '' 
`` I never touched Mrs. Norris ! '' 
`` But we do have a set of suspicious circumstances here . Why was he in the upstairs corridor at all ? Why was n't he at the Halloween feast ? '' 
`` Because - because - '' 
`` because we were tired and wanted to go to bed , '' 
`` Innocent until proven guilty , Severus , '' 
`` My cat has been Petrified ! '' 
`` You do believe me , do n't you ? '' 
'' ` Course I do , '' 
`` Midnight , '' 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` Looking for another book . I think she 's trying to read the whole library before Christmas . '' 
`` Why do you want it ? '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` That I 'm Slytherin 's heir , I expect , '' 
`` Ca n't hurt to have a poke around , '' 
`` Scorch marks ! '' 
`` This is funny ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` have you , Ron ? Ron ? '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
`` Remember all that water on the floor ? Where did that come from ? Someone 's mopped it up . '' 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
`` Ask her if she saw anything , '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` Did you see anyone near here that night ? '' 
`` Look at his family , '' 
`` But how do we prove it ? '' 
`` But that 's impossible , '' 
`` How long will it take to make , anyway ? '' 
'' George said angrily to Wood . '' 
`` Why ca n't I just go to the hospital wing ? '' 
`` No - do n't - '' 
`` Yes . Well , that can sometimes happen . But the point is , the bones are no longer broken . That 's the thing to bear in mind . So , Harry , just toddle up to the hospital wing - ah , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger , would you escort him ? - and Madam Pomfrey will be able to - er - tidy you up a bit . '' 
`` You will be able to , wo n't you ? '' 
`` Get off ! '' 
`` Dobby ! '' 
`` Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter . Ah sir , why did n't you heed Dobby ? Why did n't Harry Potter go back home when he missed the train ? '' 
`` What 're you doing here ? '' 
`` It was you ! '' 
`` Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward '' 
`` but Dobby did n't care , sir , for he thought Harry Potter was safe , and never did Dobby dream that Harry Potter would get to school another way ! '' 
`` Bad Dobby , very bad Dobby ... '' 
`` So there is a Chamber of Secrets ? '' 
`` And did you say it 's been opened before ? Tell me , Dobby ! '' 
`` Dark deeds are planned in this place , but Harry Potter must not be here when they happen - go home , Harry Potter , go home . Harry Potter must not meddle in this , sir , ` tis too dangerous - '' 
`` Who is it , Dobby ? '' 
`` I 'm not going anywhere ! '' 
`` It 's me , '' 
`` Shall we go ? '' 
`` As long as it 's not - '' 
`` I would n't bet on that , '' 
`` Who cares ? '' 
`` Weasley , you can partner Finnigan . Potter - '' 
`` And bow ! '' 
`` When I count to three , cast your charms to disarm your opponents - only to disarm them - we do n't want any accidents - one ... two ... three - '' 
`` Tarantallegra ! '' 
`` Leave him alone ! '' 
`` You 're a Parselmouth . Why did n't you tell us ? '' 
`` I 'm a what ? '' 
`` It 's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them , '' 
`` Id like to see you try it . '' 
`` Oh , hello , Hagrid , '' 
`` All righ ' , Harry ? '' 
`` Canceled , '' 
`` Second one killed this term , '' 
`` It 's either foxes or a Blood-Suckin Bugbear , an ' I need the Headmaster 's permission ter put a charm around the hen coop . '' 
`` Yeh sure yeh 're all righ ' ? Yeh look all hot an ' bothered - '' 
`` It 's nothing , '' 
`` Id better get going , Hagrid , it 's Transfiguration next and I 've got to pick up my books . '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Right . I 'll wait outside then , Headmaster . '' 
`` You do n't think it was me , Professor ? '' 
`` But I still want to talk to you . '' 
`` Anything at all . '' 
`` I 've filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught . All you have to do is make sure Crabbe and Goyle find them . You know how greedy they are , they 're bound to eat them . Once they 're asleep , pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom closet . '' 
`` Oh , all right , all right , '' 
`` Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go wrong ? '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` Azkaban ? '' 
`` I know we still have n't found out who 's doing the attacks , but I 'm going to write to Dad tomorrow and tell him to check under the Malfoys ' drawing room . '' 
`` Let 's go and see , '' 
`` What 's up , Myrtle ? '' 
`` Come to throw something else at me ? '' 
`` Why would I throw something at you ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Some of the books the Ministry 's confiscated Dad 's told me - there was one that burned your eyes out . And * 2 % 0 * everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the rest of their lives . And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading ! You just had to wander around with your nose in it , trying to do everything one-handed . And - '' 
`` All right , I 've got the point , '' 
`` Well , we wo n't find out unless we look at it , '' 
`` T M. Tom Riddle '' 
`` How on earth d'you know that ? '' 
`` He never wrote in it , '' 
`` He must 've been Muggle-born , '' 
`` Well , the Chamber of Secrets was opened fifty years ago , was n't it ? '' 
`` The moment their acne clears up , they 'll be ready for repotting again , '' 
`` given himself away '' 
`` Oh , Potter , you rotter ... '' 
`` I do n't think there 'll be any more trouble , Minerva , '' 
`` Not here , '' 
`` Let me go ! '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` That 's where I am now , '' 
`` Of course I know about the Chamber of Secrets . In my day , they told us it was a legend , that it did not exist . But this was a lie . In my fifth year , the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several students , finally killing one . I caught the person whod opened the Chamber and he was expelled . But the Headmaster , Professor Dippet , ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts , forbade me to tell the truth . A story was given out that thegirl had died in a freak accident . They gave me a nice , shiny , engraved trophy for my trouble and warned me to keep my mouth shut . But I knew it could happen again . The monster lived on , and the one who had the power to release it was not imprisoned . '' 
`` You do n't have to take my word for it . I can take you inside my memory of the night when I caught him . '' 
`` Let me show you . '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` Er - I 'll just go , shall I ? '' 
`` Sorry I disturbed you . I 'll go now , '' 
`` What are you doing , wandering around this late , Tom ? '' 
`` Best not to roam the corridors these days . Not since ... '' 
`` It was Hagrid , Ron . Hagrid opened the Chamber of Secrets fifty years ago . '' 
`` We always knew Hagrid had been expelled , '' 
`` And Tom Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if they closed Hogwarts , '' 
`` I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore , '' 
`` Come now , '' 
`` We were n't there , remember ? '' 
`` C'mon , Fang , we 're going for a walk , '' 
`` Lumos ! '' 
`` Oh , no , oh , no , oh - '' 
`` Shut up , '' 
`` What d'you think it 's doing ? '' 
`` D'you think it 's gone ? '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` I wondered where it had gone ! '' 
`` We 've lost the trail , '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Men , '' 
`` My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid , on my command . But I can not deny them fresh meat , when it wanders so willingly into our midst . Good-bye , friend of Hagrid . '' 
`` Get Fang ! '' 
`` I bet he thought Aragog would n't hurt friends of his , '' 
`` He always thinks monsters are n't as bad as they 're * 280 * made out , and look where it 's got him ! A cell in Azkaban ! '' 
`` That Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets , '' 
`` Ron , '' 
`` Ron - '' 
`` Ron - that girl who died . Aragog said she was found in a bathroom , '' 
`` We 're still getting exams ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` We were going to - to go and see - '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` We have n't seen her for ages , Professor , '' 
`` Of course , I realize this has all been hardest on the friends of those who have been ... I quite understand . Yes , Potter , of course you may visit Miss Granger . I will inform Professor Binns where you 've gone . Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my permission . '' 
`` A giant snake ... Someone would 've seen ... '' 
`` Pipes , '' 
'' They ran downstairs . Not wanting to be discovered hanging around in another corridor , they went straight into the deserted staff room . It was a large , paneled room full of dark , wooden chairs . Harry and Ron paced around it , too excited to sit down . But the bell to signal break never came . Instead , echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon agall 's voice , magically magnified . ` All students to return to their House dormitories at once . All teach ers return to the staff room . Immediately , please . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` So sorry - dozed off - what have I missed ? '' 
`` I mean , she was a pure - blood . There ca n't be any other reason . '' 
`` D'you think there 's any chance at all she 's not - you know = '' 
`` I 'm rather busy at the moment - if you would be quick - '' 
`` Professor , we 've got some information for you , '' 
`` I mean - well all right - '' 
`` Are you going somewhere ? '' 
`` You 're the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ! '' 
`` You mean you 're running away ? '' 
`` You wrote them ! '' 
`` So you 've just been taking credit for what a load of other people have done ? '' 
`` Awfully sorry , boys , but I 'll have to put a Memory Charm on you now . Ca n't have you blabbing my secrets all over the place . Id never sell another book - '' 
`` Expelliarmus ! '' 
`` Should n't have let Professor Snape teach us that one , '' 
`` You 're in luck , '' 
`` To ask you how you died , '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` Where exactly did you see the eyes ? '' 
`` But - '' 
`` Open up , '' 
`` Open up , '' 
`` I 'm going down there , '' 
`` Boys , what good will it do ? '' 
`` We must be miles under the school , '' 
`` Lumos ! '' 
`` C'mon , '' 
`` Remember , '' 
`` So you can - can get back through . And , Harry - '' 
`` See you in a bit , '' 
`` tinny ! '' 
`` tinny - do n't be dead - please do n't be dead - '' 
`` Tom - Tom Tom Riddle ? '' 
`` What d'you mean , she wo n't wake ? '' 
`` But only just . '' 
`` Are you a ghost ? '' 
`` Did you see - ? '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Listen , '' 
`` What d'you mean ? '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` I do n't think you get it . We 're in the Chamber of Secrets . We can talk later - '' 
`` How did Ginny get like this ? '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` What d'you mean ? '' 
'' Have n't you guessed yet , Harry Potter ? '' 
`` And why did you want to meet me ? '' 
`` Your whole fascinating history . '' 
`` I knew I must find out more about you , talk to you , meet you if I could . So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great oaf , Hagrid , to gain your trust - '' 
`` Hagrid 's my friend , '' 
`` I bet Dumbledore saw right through you , '' 
`` Well , you have n't finished it , '' 
`` Why do you care how I escaped ? '' 
`` Fawkes ? '' 
`` And that - '' 
`` No one knows why you lost your powers when you attacked me , '' 
`` I do n't know myself But I know why you could n't kill me . Because my mother died to save me . My common Muggle-born mother , '' 
`` So . Your mother died to save you . Yes , that 's a powerful countercharm . I can see now ... there is nothing special about you , after all . I wondered , you see . There are strange likenesses between us , after all . Even you must have noticed . Both half-bloods , orphans , raised by Muggles . Probably the only two Parselmouths to come to Hogwarts since the great Slytherin himself We even look something alike ... but after all , it was merely a lucky chance that saved you from me . That 's all I wanted to know . '' 
`` Speak to me , Slytherin , greatest of the Hogwarts Four . '' 
`` Do n't leave me ! '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` Help me , help me , '' 
`` Harry -- oh , Harry -- I tried to tell you at b-breakfast , but I c-couldn ' t say it in front of Percy -- it was me , Harry -- but I -- I s-swear I d - diddt mean to -- R-Tom Riddle made me , he t-took me over -- and - how did you kill that -- that thing ? W-where 's Tom Riddle ? The last thing I r - remember is him coming out of the diary -- '' 
'' It 's all right , '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
`` Ginny 's okay ! I 've got her ! '' 
'' So Harry , his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking , told them about Fawkes 's timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword . But then he faltered . He had so far avoided mentioning Tom Riddle 's diary -- or Ginny . She was standing with her head against Molly Weasley 's shoulder , and tears were still coursing silently down her cheeks . What if they expelled her ? Harry thought in panic . Tom Riddle 's diary did n't work anymore ... How could they prove it had been he who 'd made her do it all ? Instinctively , Harry looked at Dumbledore , who smiled faintly , the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles . '' 
`` I imagine he was most interested in you ... '' 
`` Which makes you very different from Tom Tom Riddle . It is our choices , Harry , that show what we truly are , far more than our abilities . '' 
`` Do n't you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary , Mr. Malfoy ? '' 
`` Because you gave it to her , '' 
`` In Flourish and Blotts . You picked up her old Transfiguration book and slipped the diary inside it , did n't you ? '' 
`` Least I could do , Dobby , '' 
`` I 've just got one question , Dobby , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Proud ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` I hope everything 's okay , '' 
`` Blimey , Dudley , '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` Good-bye , '' 
`` We 'll never be here again . Do n't you want to remember all the good times ? I mean , look at this doormat . What memories ... Dudley puked on it after I saved him from the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all , can you believe it ? ... And last summer , Dumbledore walked through that front door ... '' 
`` And under here , Hedwig '' 
`` is where I used to sleep ; You never knew me then -- Blimey , it 's small , I 'd forgotten ... '' 
`` Definitely , '' 
`` Let 's get undercover before we talk you through it . '' 
`` You got married ? '' 
`` We ca n't wait for the Trace to break , because the moment you turn seventeen you 'll lose all the protection your mother gave you . In short : Pius Thicknesse thinks he 's got you cornered good and proper . '' 
`` We 're going to use the only means of transport left to us , the only ones the Trace ca n't detect , because we do n't need to cast spells to use them : brooms , thestrals , and Hagrid 's motorbike . '' 
`` No -- HEDWIG ! '' 
`` Hedwig -- Hedwig -- '' 
`` Hagrid , we 've got to go back , we 've got to go back ! '' 
`` Stop -- STOP ! '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
`` Wingardium Leviosa ! '' 
`` Impedimenta ! '' 
`` I 'm comin ' , Harry , I 'm comin ' ! '' 
`` Confringo ! '' 
`` That 's him , it 's him , it 's the real one ! '' 
`` I do n't know ! '' 
`` It 's the real one ! '' 
`` I think we 've lost ’em Harry , I think we 've done it !! '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Yeah , me too . I ca n't believe -- '' 
`` You ! '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` The Portkey , '' 
`` Yeah , we do , '' 
`` I -- '' 
`` I 'll tell Tonks -- Dora -- to send word , when she ... Thanks for patching us up , thanks for everything . I -- '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` She ... she got hit , '' 
`` Never mind , '' 
`` What d’you mean ? Is n't anyone else back ? '' 
`` The Death Eaters were waiting for us , '' 
`` We were surrounded the moment we took off -- they knew it was tonight -- I do n't know what happened to anyone else , four of them chased us , it was all we could do to get away , and then Voldemort caught up with us -- '' 
`` None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight , '' 
`` What happened ? How did you escape ? '' 
`` I ... '' 
`` We were hundreds of feet up ! Stan 's not himself and if I stunned him and he 'd fallen , he 'd have died the same as if I 'd used Avada Kedavra !! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two years ago , '' 
`` So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike ? '' 
`` I wo n't blast people out of my way just because they 're there . '' 
`` I know that -- '' 
`` Mad -- Eye would n't want -- '' 
`` I KNOW ! '' 
`` It was n't me , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` It was n't like that , '' 
`` Please ... I beg you ... '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I probably look better than Ollivander ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` The Trace 'll break on the thirty-first , '' 
`` We 've got to stay for the wedding . 79 80 CHAPTER 6 . THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS They 'll kill us if we miss it . '' 
`` they '' 
`` Of 84 CHAPTER 6 . THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS course , none of our guests are Death Eaters , but we can not guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey ' aev ' ad champagne . '' 
`` I can help , some of it 's my mess . '' 
`` but , er , Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius 's bike , and , er , I 'm hiding -- that 's to say , keeping -- it in here . Fantastic stuff ! There 's an exhaust gaskin , as I believe it 's called , the most magnificent battery , and it 'll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work . I 'm going to try and put it all back together again when Molly 's not -- I mean , when I 've 85 got time . '' 
`` But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse , '' 
`` He could have used a Shield Charm -- '' 
`` Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand , '' 
`` It 's dreadful that he 's dead ! But we 're being realistic ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` Listen , '' 
`` I know you said after Dumbledore 's funeral that you wanted to come with me , '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` -- are you sure you 've thought this through ? '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` That 's your ghoul , is n't it ? '' 
`` Come and have a look at him . '' 
`` Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I think he 's really looking forward to it -- well , it 's hard to tell , because all he can do is moan and drool -- but he nods a lot when you mention it . Anyway , he 's going to be me with spattergroit . Good , eh ? '' 
`` And your mum and dad are in on this plan ? '' 
`` If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were , I 'd agree with you , '' 
`` He might expect you to go back and visit your parents ' graves once you 're free to go wherever you like ? '' 
`` He said in his note that he was going to destroy it , did n't he ? '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` But when did you do this ? '' 
`` He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven , '' 
`` Why ? How do you do it ? '' 
`` What , stabbing it with a basilisk fang ? '' 
`` It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux ca n't repair itself . Basilisk venom only has one antidote , and it 's incredibly rare -- '' 
`` -- phoenix tears , '' 
`` Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being . '' 
`` That diary sort of died when I stabbed it , '' 
`` I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring ? '' 
`` Why did n't I ask him ? I never really ... '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` then we 'll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes ... It 'll be like a holiday , wo n't it ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` I did n't mean -- well , your safety 's much more important ! Actually , I 've been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday , Harry . Seventeen , after all , it 's an important day ... '' 
`` I do n't want a fuss , '' 
`` That 'd be great , '' 
`` Oi , wake up , '' 
'' said Molly Weasley , beaming at him . '' 
'' she added to Ron , who seemed not to hear her . '' 
`` If you keep groping her every chance you get -- '' 
`` It wo n't happen again , '' 
`` Ar , not bad . Bin busy , we got some newborn unicorns . I 'll show yeh when yeh get back -- '' 
`` Here , Harry -- couldn ' think what ter get yeh , but then I remembered this . '' 
`` Sorry to intrude , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` There will be no need for you to accompany us , Arthur . '' 
`` We 're not going anywhere , '' 
`` You can speak to us together , or not at all . '' 
`` Very well then , together , '' 
`` I am here , as I 'm sure you know , because of Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore 's will . '' 
`` Yes , all of -- '' 
`` Dumbledore was very fond of you . '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` I suppose so , '' 
`` I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch , '' 
`` but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object . You know why , I 'm sure ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is 113 released , not even by the maker , who wears gloves . It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it , in the case of disputed capture . This Snitch '' 
`` will remember your touch , Potter . It occurs to me that Dumbledore , who had prodigious magical skill , whatever his other faults , might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Take it , '' 
`` That was dramatic , '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` The sword of Godric Gryffindor , '' 
`` So where is it ? '' 
`` That does not make it the exclusive property of Harry Potter , whatever Dumbledore may have decided . '' 
`` -- Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword ? '' 
`` Interesting theory , '' 
`` No ! D’you want to give him an excuse to arrest us ? '' 
`` Remembered you 're not at school , have you ? '' 
`` It 's time you earned it . '' 
`` It -- it was nothing , '' 
`` I ... regret your attitude , '' 
`` I do n't like your methods , Minister , '' 
`` Remember ? '' 
`` To give us what Dumbledore left us , '' 
`` Meet us upstairs , '' 
`` D’you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine 117 everything he 'd left us ? '' 
`` Yeah , well , '' 
`` The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match ? '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Writing ! There 's writing on it , quick , look ! '' 
`` Well , of course I do ! '' 
`` Cousin Barny '' 
`` Wotcher , '' 
`` It 's fine , I understand . '' 
`` my daughter and I live just over the hill , so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us . but I think you know my Luna ? '' 
`` Hello , Harry ! '' 
`` Er -- my name 's Barny , '' 
`` Oh , have you changed that too ? '' 
`` Oh , just your expression , '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` I 've thought o writing to you , '' 
`` after Dumbledore ... the shock ... and for you , I am sure ... '' 
`` I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet , '' 
`` Well , in that interview . '' 
`` Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved int he Dark Arts when he was young . '' 
`` Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach . He remembered . He had even handled the thing as they passed it around , each trying in turn to pry it open . It had been tossed into a sack of rubbish , along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box that had made everyone sleepy ... '' 
`` Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us , '' 
`` He had a whole stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen . C’mon . '' 
`` It 's not over yet , '' 
`` Kreacher ! '' 
`` ... There was a boat ... '' 
`` How did you get away ? '' 
`` Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back , '' 
`` Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back , '' 
`` But ... you could n't Apparate in and out of that cave , '' 
`` Elf magic is n't like wizard 's magic , is it ? '' 
`` So what happened when you got back ? '' 
`` I told you not to call her 'M udblood ' ! '' 
`` Stop him -- stop him ! '' 
`` Kreacher -- stop , stop ! '' 
`` So you brought the locket home , '' 
`` I do n't understand you , Kreacher , '' 
`` that Regulus changed his mind ... but he does n't seem to have explained that to Kreacher , does he ? '' 
`` How do they -- ? '' 
`` -- and he left me the Deluminator , maybe I 'm supposed to use it ! '' 
`` Do n't move ! '' 
`` Show yourself ! '' 
`` Oh , all right . '' 
`` but I had to check , did n't I ? '' 
`` Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher , I quit agree that you had to check . Ron , Hermione , you should n't be quite so quick to lower your defenses . '' 
`` No sign of Severus then ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` What 's going on ? Is everyone okay ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a cafe ´ on Tottenham Court Road . '' 
`` And it does n't seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time , does it ? '' 
`` Apart from anything else , they 'd know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him , would n't they ? But I ca n't see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road , that 's worrying , really worrying . '' 
`` There were about a dozen of them , but they did n't know you were there , Harry . Arthur heard a rumor that they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him ; if it 's true , he did n't give you away . '' 
`` And this dramatic change in Ministry policy , '' 
`` involves warning the Wizarding world against me instead of Voldemort ? '' 
`` That was announced yesterday . It 's a change , because it was never obligatory before . Of course , nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts , but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred . This way , Voldemort will have the whole Wizarding population under his eye fro ma young age . And it 's also another way of weeding out Muggle-borns , because students must be given Blood Status -- meaning that they have proven to the ministry that they are of wizard descent -- before they are allowed to attend . '' 
`` He did , '' 
`` and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they 're coming with me . '' 
`` Can you confide in me what the mission is ? '' 
`` But I ought still be of some use to you . You know what I am and what I can do . I could come with you to provide protection . There would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to . '' 
`` Congratulations , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I 'm not . I 'm pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why you are n't sticking with your own kid , actually . '' 
`` Explain , then , '' 
`` I see , '' 
`` so you 're just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us ? '' 
`` Oh , I do n't know , Hermione , '' 
`` I 'd be pretty ashamed of him . '' 
`` If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad , '' 
`` what will they do to a half-werewolf whose father 's in the Order ? My father died trying to protect my mother and me , and you reckon he 'd tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us ? '' 
`` This is not about a desire for -- for danger of personal glory -- how dare you suggest such a -- '' 
`` I think you 're feeling a bit of a daredevil . '' 
`` You fancy stepping into Sirius 's shoe -- '' 
`` I 'd never have believed this , '' 
`` It was easy , '' 
`` Do n't look at me like that ! '' 
`` He had it coming to him , '' 
`` should n't leave their kids unless -- unless they 've got to . '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` but if it makes him go back to Tonks , it 'll be worth it , wo n't it ? '' 
`` Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher , Master . '' 
`` Wha 've I done ? Setting a bleedin ' ' ouse-elf on me , what are you playing at , wha 've I done , lem me go , lem me go , or -- '' 
`` You 're not in much of a position to make threats , '' 
`` You 've done really well , Kreacher , '' 
`` Right , we 've got a few questions for you , '' 
`` Well , you 're a bunch of bleeidin ' ' eroes then , are n't you , but I never pretended I was up for killing myself -- '' 
`` We 're not interested in why you ran out on Mad-eye , '' 
`` Well then , why the ' ell am I being ' unted down by ' ouse-elves ? Or is this about them goblet again ? I ai n't got none of ’em left , or you could ' ave ’em -- '' 
`` It 's not about the goblets either , although you 're getting warmer , '' 
`` When you cleaned out his house of anything valuable , '' 
`` Kreacher , no ! '' 
`` We need him conscious , Kreacher , but if he needs persuading , you can do the honors , '' 
`` When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find , '' 
`` you took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard . There was a locket there . '' 
`` Who was this woman ? '' 
`` Death Eaters , '' 
`` There are pictures of them inside . They were at the top off the tower when Snape killed Dumbledore , so it 's all friends together . And , '' 
`` I ca n't see that the 196 CHAPTER 12 . MAGIC IS MIGHT other teachers have got any choice but to stay . If the Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it 'll be a choice between staying and teaching , or a nice few years in Azkaban -- and that 's if they 're lucky . I reckon they 'll stay to try and protect the students . '' 
`` Thanks , Kreacher , '' 
`` There are still a load of Death Eaters watching the house , '' 
`` more than usual . It 's like they 're hoping we 'll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the Hogwarts Express . '' 
`` I 've been thinking about that all day . It left nearly six hours ago . Weird , not being on it , is n't it ? '' 
`` They nearly saw me coming back in just now , '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` Ron , it all matters ! If we 're going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when they 're bound to be on the lookout for intruders , every little detail matters ! We 've been over and over this , I mean , what 's the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you are n't even bothering to tell us -- '' 
`` Blimey , Hermione , I forget one little thing -- '' 
`` You do realize , do n't you , that there 's probably no more dangerous place in the whole world for us to be right now than the Ministry of -- '' 
`` I think we should do it tomorrow , '' 
`` If I do n't turn up , my wife ... I mean , Cattermole 's wife -- '' 
`` We 'll come with you , we should stick together -- '' 
`` Dirk Cresswell , eh ? From Goblin Liaison ? Nice one , Albert , I 'm pretty confident I 'll get his job now ! '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' 
`` Needed a quick word with , '' 
`` Arthur Weasley . Someone said he was up on level one . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Good day , Minister . '' 
`` Accio Locket . '' 
`` She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge , she could n't refuse , and -- '' 
`` I -- so what if I did ? '' 
`` And if he survives Azkaban , you 'll have to answer to him , not to mention his wife , his sons , and his friends -- '' 
`` Arthur , '' 
`` you know you 're being tracked , do n't you ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` it 's a fact ! They 're watching your every move -- '' 
`` I 'm behind you , '' 
`` Quickly ! '' 
`` I wanted somewhere enclosed , undercover , and this was -- '' 
`` -- the first place you thought of , '' 
`` Let 's stay here for now , '' 
`` I did n't mean it to happen ! '' 
`` We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around , '' 
`` Shut up ! '' 
`` Hermione , be quiet , I can hear someone ! '' 
`` You cast the Muffliato charm over us , right ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` About the kid who tried to steal Gryffindor 's sword out of Snape 's office at Hogwarts ? '' 
`` Griphook here told me , he heard about it from Bill Weasley who works for the bank . One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill 's younger sister . '' 
`` Never mind where we are , '' 
`` Maybe , '' 
`` yes . That silly girl acted most unwisely there -- '' 
`` They were n't thieving , '' 
`` Never mind that ! How did Snape punish Ginny , Neville , and Luna ? '' 
`` And Snape might 've thought that was a punishment , '' 
`` but Ginny , Neville , and Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid . The Forbidden Forest ... they 've faced plenty worse than the Forbidden Forest , big deal ! '' 
`` Do n't call Hermione simple , '' 
`` Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns whoa re ignorant , Potter . The portraits of Hogwarts may commune with each other , but they can not ravel outside the castle except to visit a painting of themselves hanging elsewhere . Dumbledore can not come here with me , and after the treatment I have received at your hands , I can assure you that I shall not be making a return visit ! '' 
`` I know ! '' 
`` Not at Hogwarts , '' 
`` The Shrieking Shack ? '' 
'' And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and his father this time . He moved toward her , feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest , the same sensation he had had right after Dumbledore had died , a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs . The headstone was only two rooms behind Kendra and Ariana 's . It was made of white marble , just like Dumbledore 's tomb , and this made it easy to 283 read , as it seemed to shine in the dark . Harry did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it . JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death . Harry read the words slowly , as though he would have only one chance to take in their meaning , and he read the last of them aloud . ``` The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death ' ... '' 
`` It 's okay , '' 
`` Let me do that , '' 
'' Tergeo '' 
`` Miss Bagshot ? '' 
`` Who is this person ? '' 
`` Do you know who this is ? '' 
'' This man ? Do you know him ? What 's he called ? '' 
`` Who is this man ? '' 
`` This picture , Hermione , it 's the thief , the thief who stole from Gregorovitch ! Please ! '' 
`` You want us to leave ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
'' I think she does . '' 
`` Lead the way , '' 
`` Lumos , '' 
`` Have you got anything for me ? '' 
`` Have you got anything for me ? '' 
`` Have you got anything for me ? ''

`` No ! '' 
'' Yesss ... hold you ... hold you ... ''

`` Nice costume , mister ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Harry -- '' 
`` The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents . He ended up in there himself , once Dumbledore had caught him . Anyway , it 's -- it 's an awful though that Dumbledore 's ideas helped Grindelwald rise to power But on the other hand , even Rita ca n't pretend that they knew each other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young , and -- '' 
`` I thought you 'd say that , '' 
`` Whatever was wrong with that girl , I do n't think she was a Squib . The Dumbledore we know would never , ever have allowed -- '' 
`` The Dumbledore we thought we knew did n't want to conquer Muggles by force ! '' 
`` Maybe I am ! '' 
`` Look what he asked from me , Hermione ! Risk your life , Harry ! And again ! And again ! And do n't expect me to explain everything , just trust me blindly , trust that I know what I 'm doing , trust me even though I do n't trust you ! Never the whole truth ! Never ! '' 
`` I know he loved you . '' 
`` I do n't know who he loved , Hermione , but it was never me . This is n't love , the mess he 's left me in . He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than he ever shared with me . '' 
`` I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside , I even thought I saw somebody once or twice . '' 
`` The snow in the dark , it plays tricks on your eyes ... But perhaps we ought to Diapparate under the Invisibility Cloak , just in case ? '' 
`` Where are we ? '' 
`` Sorry ? '' 
`` I could feel it , it was hot . And once it was inside me I knew where I was supposed to do , I knew it would take me where I needed to go . So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a hill . There was snow everywhere ... '' 
`` We were there , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Speaking of Dumbledore , have you heard what Skeeter wrote about him ? '' 
`` people are talking about it quite a lot . ' Course , if things were different , it 'd be huge news . Dumbledore being pals with Grindel - 338 CHAPTER 20 . XENOPHILIUS LOVEGOOD wald , but now it 's just something to laugh about for people who did n't like Dumbledore , and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone who though he was such a good bloke . I do n't know that it 's such a big deal , though . He was really young when they -- '' 
`` Our age , '' 
`` I 'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young , okay ? '' 
`` It 's all a matter of confidence , Harry . '' 
`` that tells the news like it really is . All the others are on Voldemort 's side and are following the Ministry line , but this one ... you wait till you hear it , it 's great . Only they ca n't do it every night , they have to keep changing locations in case they 're raided , and you need a password to tune in ... Trouble is , I missed the lsat one ... '' 
`` I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald 's mark , but it was definitely on that old grave in Godric 's Hollow , and the dates on the headstone were long before Grindelwald came along ! And now this ! Well , we ca n't ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald what it means -- I do n't even know if Grindelwald 's stil alive -- but we can ask Xenophilius Lovegood . he was wearing the symbol at the wedding . I 'm sure this is important , Harry ! '' 
`` Hermione , we do n't need another Godric 's Hollow . We talked ourselves into going there , and -- '' 
`` Here we go again ! '' 
`` I think 341 Hermione 's right , I think we ought to go and see Lovegood . '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` These are the Wrackspurt siphons -- to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker 's immediate area . Here , ''

`` We make it ourselves . ''

`` Come on , '' 
`` we 've got to get out of here . '' 
`` Do you trust me , Harry ? '' 
`` Please , Ron ! Harry , hold on tight to my hand , Ron , grab my shoulder . '' 
`` Not really , '' 
`` Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig , all he cared about was his ancestry . If that ring had been passed down through the centuries , he might not have known what it really was . There were no books in that house , and trust me , he was n't the type to read fairy tales to his kids . He 'd have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms , because as far as he was concerned , having pure blood made you practically royal . '' 
`` Read it , '' 
`` You -- you reckon ? '' 
`` This is it ? '' 
`` I did n't really believe it ! '' 
`` You do n't believe in this , do you ? '' 
`` We 're not the one with an obsession , Harry ! We 're the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do ! '' 
`` On what ? '' 
`` Listeners , I 'd like to invite you now to join us in a minute 's silence in memory of Ted Tonks , Dirk Cresswell , Bathilda Bagshot , Gornuk , and the unnamed , but no less regretted , Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters . '' 
'' ``` Rodent ' ? '' 
`` So , people , let 's try and calm down a bit . Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well . For instance , this new idea that Voldemort can kill people with a single glance from his eyes . That 's a 381 basilisk , listeners . One simple test : Check whether the thing that 's glaring at you has got legs . If it has , it 's safe to look into its eyes , although if it really is Voldemort , that 's still likely to be the last thing you ever do . '' 
`` Brilliant , '' 
`` But did you hear what Fred said ? '' 
`` Get up , vermin . '' 
`` Delicious girl ... what a treat 383 384 CHAPTER 23 . MALFOY MANOR ... I do enjoy the softness of the skin ... '' 
`` I 'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down . What happened to you , ugly ? '' 
`` Stung . '' 
`` Dudley . '' 
`` So you 're related to blood traitors even if 385 you 're not a Mudblood . And lastly , your pretty little friend ... '' 
`` What 's that on your forehead , Vernon ? '' 
`` It could be . '' 
`` What is that ? '' 
`` How dare you ? '' 
`` I 'd say I 'll get a bite or two , would n't you , ginger ? '' 
`` Be quiet ! '' 
`` Luna , can you help us get these ropes off ? '' 
`` Mr. Ollivander ? '' 
`` There ! '' 
`` Draco , fetch the goblin , he can tell us whether the sword is real or not ! '' 
`` Griphook , '' 
`` DOB -- ! '' 
`` You can Disapparate out of this cellar ? '' 
`` And then come back , '' 
`` Go , both of you ! We 'll see you at Bill and Fleur 's . '' 
`` Go ! '' 
`` Did you hear that ? What was that noise in the cellar ? '' 
`` We 're going to have to try and tackle him , '' 
`` Leave the lights on , '' 
`` All fine ! '' 
`` You 're going to kill me ? '' 
`` Is it the true sword ? '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
`` How do you know this ? '' 
`` He wanted to know everything I could tell him about the wand variously known as the Deathstick , the Wand of Destiny , or the Elder Wand . '' 
`` But he 'll know soon , if he does n't already , that mine 's broken beyond repair , '' 
`` Priori Incantatem , '' 
`` Let 's not worry about that now -- '' 
`` Mr. Ollivander , '' 
`` you told Voldemort that Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand , did n't you ? '' 
`` Never mind how I know it , '' 
`` Yes , I can see that , '' 
`` I 'm afraid I do n't know what you 're talking about . Is this still something to do with wands ? '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` He was torturing me ! '' 
`` The Cruciatus Curse ... you have no idea ... '' 
`` I do , '' 
`` I really do . Please get some rest . Thank you for telling me all of this . '' 
`` At Hogwarts , '' 
`` It 's too late for that , '' 
`` How long have you known this -- why have we been wasting time ? Why did you talk to Griphook first ? We could have gone -- we could still go -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Harry , if that really is the Elder Wand , how the hell are we supposed to finish off Voldemort ? '' 
`` I could have , '' 
`` No , I do n't , '' 
`` Dumbledore would n't come back as a ghost , ''

`` I ca n't leave , '' 
`` Oh , did he now ? And did he tell you everything , was he honest with you ? '' 
`` Yes , ''

`` He was never free , '' 
`` Never , ''

`` I might not be able to save ’em a third time . '' 
`` Yeah , it 's true , '' 
`` You 're right , '' 
`` Amycus , the bloke , he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts , except now it 's just Dark Arts . We 're supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who 've earned detentions -- '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` HARRY ! '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` And the Carrows ca n't get in ? '' 
`` -- and if Hogwarts is about to enter a stage of siege , with the Dark Lord at the gates , it would indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible . With the Floo network under observation , and Apparition impossible within the grounds -- '' 
`` There 's a way , '' 
`` You means he 's dead ? '' 
`` Unlike Dumbledore , he was still carrying a wand ... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master . '' 
`` Professor ! '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` Seen it ? Nobody has seen it in living memory ! Long since lost , my boy ! '' 
`` Go and wake your students , Horace . '' 
`` May the boundaries , protect us , do your duty to our school ! '' 
`` It was him , I swear , I just saw him ! '' 
`` Wh -- ? '' 
`` They 're evacuating the younger kids and everyone 's meeting in the Great Hall to get organized , '' 
`` We 're fighting . '' 
`` My whole family 's here , I ca n't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and -- '' 
`` Am I too late ? Has it started ? I only just found out , so I -- I -- '' 
`` Where 's Ron ? '' 
`` I did n't see them pass me , '' 
`` A bathroom ? '' 
`` Then my mother fell ill-fatally ill . In spite of my perfidy , she was desperate 522 CHAPTER 31 . THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS to see me one more time . She sent a man who had long loved me , though I spurned his advances , to find me . She knew that he would not rest until he had done so . '' 
`` A hollow tree ? '' 
`` Albania , '' 
`` I had ... no idea ... He was ... flattering . He seemed to ... to understand ... to sympathize ... '' 
`` Well , you were n't the first person Tom Riddle wormed things out of , '' 
`` He hid the diadem in the castle , the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach ! '' 
`` He must 've hidden the diadem on his way up to , or down from , Dumbledore 's office ! But it was still worth trying to get the job -- then he might 've got the chance to nick Gryffindor 's sword as well ... thank you , thanks ! '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Good boy , Grawpy ! '' 
`` That , '' 
`` is a really good question . Come on . '' 
`` I dunno exactly , '' 
`` but Ron and Hermione must be around here somewhere ... '' 
`` Oh , do n't mind me ... I 'll just lie here and crumble ... '' 
`` Going to lob them over the walls -- they wo n't like this ! '' 
`` I know , we 're evacuating , '' 
`` Voldemort 's -- '' 
`` -- attacking because they have n't handed you over , yeah , '' 
`` It would n't stop Voldemort , '' 
`` and your brother would never have done it . '' 
`` Where the hell have you been ? '' 
`` Chamber -- what ? '' 
`` So ... '' 
`` Genius ! '' 
`` I know what the diadem looks like , and I know where it is , '' 
`` Are there still people in the passage to the Hog 's Head ? '' 
`` He 's fighting , '' 
`` Ginny , '' 
`` I 'm sorry , but we need you to leave too . Just for a bit . Then you can come back in . '' 
`` And then you can come back in ! '' 
`` You mean we ought to get them fighting ? '' 
`` Is this the moment ? '' 
`` Never mind that , what about the Horcrux ? '' 
`` They 'll be all right , '' 
`` Ginny , we 'll be back in a moment , just keep out of the way , keep safe -- come on ! '' 
`` He thought he was the only one , '' 
`` Too bad for him I 've had to hide stuff in my time ... this way , '' 
`` I think it 's down here ... '' 
`` Accio Diadem ! '' 
`` Let 's split up . '' 
`` Look for a stone bust of an old 531 man wearing a wig an a tiara ! It 's standing on a cupboard and it 's definitely somewhere around here ... '' 
`` Somewhere ... somewhere ... '' 
`` Hold it , Potter . '' 
`` Not anymore , '' 
`` So how come you three are n't with Voldemort ? '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
`` Finite ! '' 
`` RUN ! '' 
`` The Whomping willow , '' 
`` go ! '' 
`` Wait . '' 
`` Put the Cloak on ! '' 
`` Nox , '' 
`` Why does n't it work for me , Severus ? '' 
`` I have thought long and hard , Severus ... do you know why I have called you back from battle ? '' 
`` See ya , Snivellus ! '' 
`` I do n't need you to tell me that . But Mulciber 's and Avery 's idea of humor is just evil . Evil , Sev . I do n't understand how you can be friends with them . '' 
`` Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort tried to kill him , when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield , the Killing Curse rebounded upon Lord Voldemort , and a fragment of Voldemort 's soul was blasted apart from the whole , and latched itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building . Part of Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry , and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes , and a connection with Lord Voldemort 's mind that he has never understood . And while that fragment of soul , unmissed by Voldemort , remains attached to and protected by Harry , Lord Voldemort can not die . '' 
`` Blimey , Harry , you nearly gave me heart failure ! '' 
`` It 's all part of the plan , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` The Cloak would n't have helped them survive , though , '' 
`` True . '' 
`` Do not misunderstand me , '' 
`` But you 'd have been better , much better , than Fudge or Scrimgeour ! '' 
`` Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand . He lied , you know , pretended he had never had it . '' 
`` ... or maybe from breaking into your tomb ? '' 
`` You tried to use the Resurrection Stone . '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Oh , Harry ... Harry ... '' 
`` It 's over ! Set him down , Hagrid , at my feet , where he belongs ! '' 
`` Protego ! '' 
`` I do n't want anyone else to try to help . '' 
`` Nobody , '' 
`` Accident , was it , when my mother died to save me ? '' 
`` You wo n't be killing anyone else tonight , '' 
`` You dare -- '' 
`` Yes , I dare , '' 
`` Is it love again ? '' 
`` Just one thing , '' 
`` I believe both , '' 
`` Oh , he dreamed of it , '' 
`` but he knew more than you , knew enough not to do what you 've done . '' 
`` No , he was cleverer than you , '' 
`` a better wizard , a better man . '' 
`` You thought you did , '' 
`` but you were wrong . '' 
'' Yes , Dumbledore 's dead , '' 
`` but you did n't have him killed . He chose his own manner of dying , chose it months before he died , arranged the whole thing with the man you thought was your servant . '' 
`` Severus Snape was n't yours , '' 
`` Snape 's Patronus was a doe , '' 
`` the same as my mother 's , because he loved her for nearly all of his life , from the time when they were children . You should have realized , '' 
`` but he was Dumbledore 's spy from the moment you threatened her , and he 's been working against you ever since ! Dumbledore was already dying when Snape finished him ! '' 
`` Even if you are right , Potter , it makes no difference to you and me . You no longer have the phoenix wand : We duel on skill alone ... and after I have killed you , I can attend to Draco Malfoy ... '' 
`` But you 're too late , '' 
`` You 've missed your chance . I got there first . I overpowered Draco Malfoy weeks ago . I took this wand from him . '' 
`` So it all comes down to this , does n't it ? '' 
`` I 'd love some , '' 
`` Use your Cloak . '' 
`` It 's me , '' 
`` Will you come with me ? '' 
`` Can we go up ? '' 
`` The thing that was hidden in the Snitch , '' 
`` I dropped it in the forest . I do n't know exactly where , but I 'm not going to go looking for it again . Do you agree ? '' 
`` No one , '' 
`` I 'm going to keep Ignotus 's present , though , '' 
`` And then there 's this . '' 
`` I do n't want it . '' 
`` But I was happier with mine . So 631 ... '' 
`` I 'm putting the Elder Wand , '' 
`` That wand 's more trouble than it 's worth , '' 
`` And quite honestly , '' 
`` I 've had enough trouble for a lifetime . '' 
`` It wo n't be long now , and you 'll be going too , '' 
`` And you do n't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts , '' 
`` He already comes round for dinner about four times a week , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` you and Al will share a room only when I want the house demolished . '' 
`` Thestrals are nothing to worry about , '' 
`` By , Al , '' 
`` Albus Dumbledore Severus , '' 
`` It did for me , '' 
`` I know he will . '' 
`` for the Omnioculars ! Now you 've got to buy me a Christmas present , ha ! '' 
`` And it 's Mullet ! Troy ! Moran ! Dimitrov ! Back to Mullet ! Troy ! Levski ! Moran ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Troy -- Mullet -- Moran ! '' 
`` They 're going to crash ! '' 
`` Which is what Krum was after , of course ... '' 
`` Time-out ! Ah , come on , he ca n't play like that , look at him -- '' 
`` Look at Lynch ! '' 
`` Lynch is ! '' 
`` He 's got it -- Krum 's got it -- it 's all over ! '' 
`` He knew they were never going to catch up ! '' 
`` He looks a terrible mess ... '' 
`` Vell , ve fought bravely , '' 
`` No , master ! Not clothes , not clothes ! '' 
`` Death Eaters ? '' 
`` But what were Voldemort 's supporters -- '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` But I 'll tell you this ... it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it . I 'd be very surprised if the person who did it had n't been a Death Eater once , even if they 're not now ... CHAPTER NINE ` 144 ` Listen , it 's very late , and if your mother hears what 's happened she 'll be worried sick . We 'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here . '' 
`` I 've made things worse . I 'll just change into my robes and I 'll be off ... '' 
`` Molly Weasley , '' 
`` Hedwig has n't arrived with a letter for me , has she ? '' 
`` There 's something I have n't told you , '' 
`` I 'm sure he was n't on Privet Drive , '' 
`` But I was dreaming about him ... him and Peter -- you know , Pettigrew . I ca n't remember all of it now , but they were plotting to kill ... someone . '' 
`` me , '' 
`` Yeah , but was it , though ? '' 
`` And remember what Professor Trelawney said ? '' 
`` You were n't there , '' 
`` I told Sirius about my scar , '' 
`` I hoped he 'd get back to me quickly , '' 
`` Yeah , I know , '' 
`` Come on now , all of you ... '' 
`` It might shut him up . '' 
`` It 's been over a week , '' 
`` You 've got to have dress robes , they 're on your list ! I got some for Harry too ... show him , Harry ... '' 
`` Arthur ! Urgent message from the Ministry ! '' 
`` Dennis ! Dennis ! See that boy down there ? The one with the black hair and glasses ? See him ? Know who he is , Dennis ? '' 
`` Hear , hear ! '' 
`` Why ? Wha ' ' appened ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Moody ? '' 
`` Dragon blood 's amazingly magical , but you would n't want a dragon for a pet , would you ? '' 
`` The movements of the planets and the mysterious portents they reveal only to those who understand the steps of the celestial dance . Human destiny may be deciphered by the planetary rays , which intermingle ... '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Born under -- what , sorry ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I was born in July . '' 
`` I 've got two Neptunes here , '' 
`` that ca n't be right , can it ? '' 
`` Weasley ! Hey , Weasley ! '' 
`` Get stuffed , Malfoy , '' 
`` You know your mother , Malfoy ? '' 
`` Keep your fat mouth shut , then , '' 
`` OH NO YOU DO N'T , LADDIE ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` missed . '' 
`` Leave -- what ? '' 
`` Draco Malfoy , the amazing bouncing ferret ... '' 
`` Do n't tell me you 're going back to the library this evening ? '' 
`` What was it like ? '' 
`` Doing what ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` I reckon Snape 's a bit scared of him , you know , '' 
`` Been in the -- '' 
`` Library . '' 
`` Not pleasant . And there 's no countercurse . There 's no blocking it . Only one known person has ever survived it , and he 's sitting right in front of me . '' 
`` Nope , they 're upstairs in my bag , '' 
`` They look a lot happier than the Beauxbatons lot , '' 
`` But there are only two extra people , '' 
`` Skrewts doing all right , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Yeah , have it , '' 
`` They make them okay at Hogwarts , '' 
`` What are they doing here ? '' 
`` The Triwizard Tournament is about to start . I would like to say a few words of explanation before we bring in the casket -- '' 
`` The what ? '' 
`` You 'll try and get in , wo n't you , Harry ? '' 
`` You ! '' 
`` Bet some of them put it in last night after we 'd all gone to bed , '' 
`` C’mon , then -- I 'll go first -- '' 
`` That big bloke from Slytherin who looks like a sloth . '' 
`` Are you seventeen , then ? '' 
`` We have n't been down to visit Hagrid yet , '' 
`` Hey , Ron , '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` Go on , Hagrid ! '' 
`` It 's her , Ron ! '' 
`` Disappointed '' 
`` I did n't put my name in , '' 
`` Extraordinary ! '' 
`` Absolutely extraordinary ! Gentlemen ... lady , '' 
`` Zey are saying zat zis little boy is to compete also ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I 'm afraid I do n't understand you , Moody . '' 
`` Mad-Eye '' 
`` The first task is designed to test your daring , '' 
`` I am sure Gryffindor and Hufflepuff are waiting to celebrate with you , and it would be a shame to deprive them of this excellent excuse to make a great deal of mess and noise . '' 
`` I s ' pose , '' 
`` I did n't , '' 
`` Balderdash , '' 
`` I did n't , '' 
`` Oh if it could n't be me , at least it 's a Gryffindor -- '' 
`` You 'll be able to pay back Diggory for that last Quidditch match , Harry ! '' 
`` Where 've you been ? '' 
`` So , '' 
`` What d’you mean , congratulations ? '' 
`` The Invisibility Cloak would n't have got me over that line , '' 
`` Listen , '' 
`` I did n't put my name in that goblet . Someone else must 've done it . '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` To kill me . '' 
`` I did n't put my name in that goblet ! '' 
`` You 're doing a really good impression of it , '' 
`` Good idea , '' 
`` The look on your face when Dumbledore read out your name ! But the question is , who did put it in ? Because Moody 's right , Harry ... I do n't think any student could have done it ... they 'd never be able to fool the Goblet , or get over Dumbledore 's -- '' 
`` Have you seen Ron ? '' 
`` Jealous ? '' 
`` I know you do n't ask for it ... but -- well -- you know , Ron 's got all those brothers to compete against at home , and you 're his best friend , and you 're really famous -- he 's always shunted to one side whenever people see you , and he puts up with it , and he never mentions it , but I suppose this is just one time too many ... '' 
`` Great , '' 
`` I 'm not running around after him trying to make him grow up ! '' 
`` Write to Sirius . You 've got to tell him what 's happened . He asked you to keep him posted on everything that 's going on at Hogwarts ... It 's almost as if he expected something like this to happen . I brought some parchment and a quill out with me -- '' 
`` Come off it , '' 
`` Okay , okay , I 'll write to him , '' 
`` Whose owl am I going to use ? '' 
`` Ask Ron if you can borrow -- '' 
`` I 'm not asking Ron for anything , '' 
`` I ca n't use you , '' 
`` First Ron , then you , '' 
`` This is n't my fault . '' 
`` So -- yer competin ' , Harry . In the tournament . School champion . '' 
`` One of the champions , '' 
`` You believe I did n't do it , then ? '' 
`` Wish I knew who did do it , '' 
`` School champion ... everythin ' seems ter happen ter you , doesn ' it ? '' 
`` You just were n't concentrating properly -- '' 
`` Wonder why that was , '' 
`` ignore them , ignore them , ignore them '' 
`` Like them , Potter ? '' 
`` And this is n't all they do -- look ! '' 
`` I 've got loads . But do n't touch my hand , now . I 've just washed it , you see ; do n't want a Mudblood sliming it up . '' 
`` Furnunculus ! '' 
`` Potter attacked me , sir -- '' 
`` We attacked each other at the same time ! '' 
`` Fifty points from Gryffindor and a detention each for Potter and Weasley . Now get inside , or it 'll be a week 's worth of detentions . '' 
`` All the champions have got to go , I think they want to take photographs ... '' 
`` Potter -- take your bag and get out of my sight ! '' 
`` Yeah , really amazing , '' 
`` Great , '' 
`` Er -- '' 
`` A what ? '' 
`` Testing ... my name is Rita Skeeter , Daily Prophet reporter . '' 
`` So , Harry ... what made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament ? '' 
`` Er -- '' 
`` Ignore the quill , Harry , '' 
`` I did n't , '' 
`` But I did n't enter , '' 
`` I have n't really thought ... yeah , nervous , I suppose , '' 
`` Well ... they say it 's going to be a lot safer this year , '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` Do you think that the trauma in your past might have made you keen to prove yourself ? To live up to your name ? Do you think that perhaps you were tempted to enter the Triwizard Tournament because -- '' 
`` I did n't enter , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` How do you think they 'd feel if they knew you were competing in the Triwizard Tournament ? Proud ? Worried ? Angry ? '' 
`` I have NOT got tears in my eyes ! '' 
`` Which leaves ... Harry Potter . '' 
`` Yes , yes , yes . How well I remember . '' 
`` Curious , '' 
`` curious , '' 
`` You may go back to your lessons now -- or perhaps it would be quicker just to go down to dinner , as they are about to end -- '' 
`` Oh -- right , '' 
`` Yeah , that 's right ! '' 
`` Oh -- right -- sorry , '' 
`` I really hope you do well . '' 
`` Just ignore it , Harry . '' 
`` I did n't start this , '' 
`` Miss him ? '' 
`` I do n't miss him ... '' 
`` They only like him because he 's famous ! They would n't look twice at him if he could n't do that WonkyFaint thing -- '' 
`` Wronski Feint , '' 
`` What about Ron , though ? '' 
`` I thought we might meet up with him in the Three Broomsticks ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Oh yeah ? '' 
`` She 's staying in the village . I bet she 's coming to watch the first task . '' 
`` Yeah , right , '' 
`` No idea , ask Fred and George , '' 
`` Look , it 's Hagrid ! '' 
`` Nice cloak , Potter . '' 
`` Harry , meet me tonight at midnight at me cabin . Wear that cloak . '' 
`` Why does Hagrid want me to meet him at midnight ? '' 
`` Thanks ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` What 're you showing me ? '' 
`` Stunning Spells , on the count of three ! '' 
`` All right , Hagrid ? '' 
`` ` How could they let him enter that tournament , he 's much too young ! I thought they were all safe , I thought there was going to be an age THE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL ` 329 ` limit ! ' She was in floods after that Daily Prophet article about him . ` He still cries about his parents ! Oh bless him , I never knew ! ' '' 
`` Ouch ! Who 's there ? '' 
`` Balderdash ! '' 
`` Sirius -- how 're you doing ? '' 
`` I 'm -- '' 
`` fine '' 
`` Dragons we can deal with , Harry , but we 'll get to that in a minute -- I have n't got long here ... I 've broken into a wizarding house to use the fire , but they could be back at any time . There are things I need to warn you about . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Karkaroff got released ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` -- you and the rest of the world , '' 
`` but I do n't think so , somehow . I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hogwarts . I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult with him around . And no one 's going to look into it too closely ; Mad-Eye 's heard intruders a bit too often . But that does n't mean he ca n't still spot the real thing . Moody was the best Auror the Ministry ever had . '' 
`` So ... what are you saying ? '' 
`` Bertha Jorkins ? '' 
`` Yeah , but ... it 's not very likely she 'd have walked straight into Voldemort , is it ? '' 
`` Thanks a lot ! '' 
`` ' Course you can , '' 
`` Let 's hope they do n't look too closely at Winky , '' 
`` Does n't think much of Bagman , though , does she ? '' 
`` Your dance partners . '' 
`` Dance partners ? '' 
`` I do n't dance , '' 
`` That 's what I 'm telling you . Traditionally , the champions and their partners open the ball . '' 
`` Got any idea who you 're going to try ? '' 
`` She was a foot taller than me , '' 
`` They only like him because he 's famous ! '' 
`` ' Course she did , '' 
`` She should 've interviewed Snape , '' 
`` Cheers , Hagrid , '' 
`` No one , yet , '' 
`` It 's Christmas , Hermione , '' 
`` Like what ? '' 
`` Come on , Hermione , I 've got till February the twenty-fourth , '' 
`` I suppose there 's always Moaning Myrtle , '' 
`` Er ... okay , '' 
`` I 'll meet you at dinner , '' 
`` Er -- Cho ? Could I have a word with you ? '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` D’you -- d’you want to go to the ball with me ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Oh okay , '' 
`` no problem . '' 
`` That 's okay , '' 
`` Oh right , '' 
`` What 's up , Ron ? '' 
`` Why did I do it ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` You what ? '' 
`` She 's part veela , '' 
`` I asked her to go with me just now , '' 
`` and she told me . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Ca n't you think of anyone who 'd go with Ron ? '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` Yeah , that would be great , '' 
`` Let me know , will you ? '' 
`` You 're not telling me someone 's asked that to the ball ? Not the long-molared Mudblood ? '' 
`` He sounds exactly like Moody , '' 
`` Yeah , okay , '' 
`` Come on , how 'm I supposed to concentrate with all this noise going on ? I wo n't even be able to hear the egg over this lot . '' 
`` Dobby ! '' 
`` It 's okay , '' 
`` Just -- just prod me or something in future , all right , do n't bend over me like that ... '' 
`` No , it 's just Dobby , '' 
`` Can Dobby give Harry Potter his present ? '' 
`` ' Course you can , '' 
`` Socks are Dobby 's favorite , favorite clothes , sir ! '' 
`` Cool ! '' 
`` They 're ... they 're really ... well , thanks , Dobby , '' 
`` You -- er -- look nice , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` See you in a minute '' 
`` Why did n't he come ? '' 
`` I 'm afraid to say Mr. Crouch is n't well , not well at all . Has n't been right since the World Cup . Hardly surprising -- overwork . He 's not as young as he was -- though still quite brilliant , of course , the mind remains as great as it ever was . But the World Cup was a fiasco for the whole Ministry , and then , Mr. Crouch suffered a huge personal shock with the misbehavior of that house-elf of his , Blinky , or whatever she was called . Naturally , he dismissed her immediately afterward , but -- well , as I say , he 's getting on , he needs looking after , and I think he 's found a definite drop in his home comforts since she left . And then we had the tournament to arrange , and the aftermath of the Cup to deal with -- that revolting Skeeter woman buzzing around -- no , poor man , he 's having a well earned , quiet Christmas . I 'm just glad he knew he had someone he could rely upon to take his place . '' 
`` Veil , ve have a castle also , not as big as this , nor as comfortable , I am thinking , '' 
`` Only this morning , for instance , I took a wrong turning on the way to the bathroom and found myself in a beautifully proportioned room I have never seen before , containing a really rather magnificent collection of chamber pots . When I went back to investigate more closely , I discovered that the room had vanished . But I must keep an eye out for it . CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE ` 418 ` Possibly it is only accessible at five-thirty in the morning . Or it may only appear at the quarter moon -- or when the seeker has an exceptionally full bladder . '' 
`` We 're supposed to dance ! '' 
`` Oh -- yeah , Dobby the house-elf knitted them for me , '' 
`` I do n't think that eye should be allowed ! '' 
`` No , I do n't like it , '' 
`` How 's it going ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Ron , '' 
`` I have n't got a problem with Hermione coming with Krum -- '' 
`` Excellent ! That 's the whole point , you know -- international magical cooperation ! '' 
`` was a little unfortunate , of course , but it seems to have gone very smoothly since , do n't you think ? '' 
`` get away from Percy ... '' 
`` And since when have he and Snape been on first-name terms ? '' 
`` Momen ' I saw yeh , I knew , '' 
`` C’mon , '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
`` Did you know ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` So what ? '' 
`` So ? '' 
`` Who cares ? '' 
`` But what 's it matter if his mother was a giantess ? '' 
`` Well , they were dying out anyway , and then loads got themselves killed by Aurors . There 're supposed to be giants abroad , though ... They hide out in mountains mostly ... '' 
`` I do n't know who Maxime thinks she 's kidding , '' 
`` If Hagrid 's half-giant , she definitely is . Big bones ... the only thing that 's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur . '' 
`` Yeah ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Oh I -- I reckon I 've got a pretty good idea what it 's about now , '' 
`` Well done ! '' 
`` He 's mad ! '' 
`` In a moment , in a moment ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Fine , thanks , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Absolute nightmare , '' 
`` Their English is n't too good ... it 's like being back with all the Bulgarians at the Quidditch World Cup ... but at least they used sign language another human could recognize . This lot keep gabbling in Gobbledegook ... and I only know one word of Gobbledegook . Bladvak . It means ` pickax . ' I do n't like to use it in case they think I 'm threatening them . '' 
`` What do they want ? '' 
`` Why are they looking for him here ? '' 
`` Have you heard anything about Bertha Jorkins ? '' 
`` I 've got people looking , of course ... '' 
`` and it 's all very strange . She definitely arrived in Albania , because she met her RITA SKEETER 'S SCOOP ` 447 ` second cousin there . And then she left the cousin 's house to go south and see an aunt ... and she seems to have vanished without trace en route . Blowed if I can see where she 's got to ... she does n't seem the type to elope , for instance ... but still ... What are we doing , talking about goblins and Bertha Jorkins ? I really wanted to ask you '' 
`` how are you getting on with your golden egg ? '' 
`` Er ... not bad , '' 
`` Listen , Harry , '' 
`` I feel very bad about all this ... you were thrown into this tournament , you did n't volunteer for it ... and if ... '' 
`` if I can help at all ... a prod in the right direction ... I 've taken a liking to you ... the way you got past that dragon ! ... well , just say the word . '' 
`` We 're supposed to work out the clues alone , are n't we ? '' 
`` Have you offered Cedric help ? '' 
`` No , I have n't , '' 
`` I -- well , like I say , I 've taken a liking to you . Just thought I 'd offer ... '' 
`` Well , thanks , '' 
`` but I think I 'm nearly there with the egg ... couple more days should crack it . '' 
`` no , thank you , boys ... '' 
`` Well , I must dash , '' 
`` Nice seeing you all . Good luck , Harry . '' 
`` He offered to help me with the golden egg , '' 
`` Er ... nearly , '' 
`` He 's not , I asked , '' 
`` Looking for Crouch , according to Bagman , '' 
`` Crouch can speak loads of different languages , though , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Trying to ruin someone else 's life ? '' 
`` I would n't come near you with a ten-foot broomstick , '' 
`` Our readers have a right to the truth , Harry . I am merely doing my -- '' 
`` Who cares if he 's half-giant ? '' 
`` ' Lo , '' 
`` Of course we still want to know you ! '' 
`` You do n't think anything that Skeeter cow -- sorry , Professor , '' 
`` Er -- right , '' 
`` Hagrid , look what I 've got for relatives ! '' 
'' He went back into his office , staring down at the Marauder 's Map again , and closed the door behind him . Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower , lost in thought about Snape , and Crouch , and what it all meant ... Why was Crouch pretending to be ill , if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to ? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office ? And Moody thought he , Harry , ought to be an Auror ! Interesting idea ... but somehow , Harry thought , as he got quietly into his four-poster ten minutes later , the egg and the cloak now safely back in his trunk , he thought he 'd like to check how scarred the rest of them were before he chose it as a career . C H A P T E R T W E N T Y - S I X ` 479 ` THE SECOND TASK ou said you 'd already worked out that egg clue ! '' 
`` Keep your voice down ! '' 
`` I just need to -- sort of fine-tune it , all right ? '' 
`` Just forget the egg for a minute , all right ? '' 
`` Well , I dunno if that 's what Dumbledore asked him to do , but he 's definitely doing it , '' 
`` I just want to know what Snape did with his first chance , if he 's on his second one , '' 
`` If only we 'd done human Transfiguration already ! But I do n't think we start that until sixth year , and it can go badly wrong if you do n't know what you 're doing ... '' 
`` Yeah , I do n't fancy walking around with a periscope sticking out of my head , '' 
`` No , I think your best chance is some sort of charm . '' 
`` Here -- take my quill and send this owl back straight away . '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` We therefore award him forty-seven points . '' 
`` The champions will be notified of what is coming precisely one month beforehand . Thank you all for your support of the champions . '' 
`` I ca n't believe him , '' 
`` if he 's caught ... '' 
`` Made it so far , though , has n't he ? '' 
`` And it 's not like the place is swarming with dementors anymore . '' 
`` ` Harry Potter 's Secret Heartache ... dear , dear , Potter , what 's ailing you now ? ` A boy like no other , perhaps ... ' '' 
`` Well , I think I had better separate the three of you , so you can keep your minds on your potions rather than on your tangled love lives . Weasley , you stay here . Miss Granger , over there , beside Miss Parkinson . Potter -- that table in front of my desk . Move . Now . '' 
`` but I do n't care how many times your picture appears in the papers . To me , Potter , you are nothing but a nasty little boy who considers rules to be beneath him . '' 
`` Boomslang skin . Gillyweed . Both come from my private stores , and I know who stole them . '' 
`` I do n't know what you 're talking about , '' 
`` Was his son a Death Eater ? '' 
`` He gave his own son to the dementors ? '' 
`` So he 's still in Azkaban ? '' 
`` Moody says Crouch is obsessed with catching Dark wizards , '' 
`` So you think Snape could be up to something , then ? '' 
`` I dunno -- maybe he thought Dumbledore would kick him out -- '' 
`` What d’you think , Sirius ? '' 
`` Yeah , you should 've seen Snape 's face when Karkaroff turned up in Potions yesterday ! '' 
`` Bagman told me they had n't , '' 
`` What 's the time ? '' 
`` No one 's tried to attack me so far , except a dragon and a couple of grindylows , '' 
`` You saved my life with that gillyweed , Dobby , you really did , '' 
`` We should get some stuff to send up to Snuffles , '' 
`` Well , it 's not strong , that stuff , '' 
`` ' Tis strong for a house-elf , sir , '' 
`` Hey , Winky , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` we have n't seen him since the first task . The Daily Prophet 's saying he 's ill . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I do n't think so , '' 
`` I 've told you , he was n't making much sense , '' 
`` He was out of his mind , '' 
`` I 've told you , '' 
`` He was having real trouble stringing two words together , but that was when he seemed to know where he was , and know what he wanted to do . He just kept saying he had to see Dumbledore . '' 
`` If Snape had n't held me up , '' 
`` we might 've got there in time . ` The headmaster is busy , Potter ... what 's this rubbish , Potter ? ' Why could n't he have just got out of the way ? '' 
`` Not unless he can turn himself into a bat or something , '' 
`` If he had the Marauder 's Map on him , it would 've been easy , '' 
`` Sending a letter , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` We were n't talking . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Professor Moody ? '' 
`` Did you find him ? '' 
`` Did you use the map ? '' 
`` Well , he was n't invisible , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Oh yeah ... '' 
`` Who 's he , to lecture me about being out-of-bounds ? '' 
`` No one 's tried to attack me all year , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` let 's say Sirius is right , and someone Stunned Krum to kidnap Crouch . Well , they would 've been in the trees near us , would n't they ? But they waited till I was out of the way until they acted , did n't they ? So it does n't look like I 'm their target , does it ? '' 
`` They did n't care about attacking Krum , did they ? '' 
`` I just know there are a lot of odd things going on , and I do n't like it ... Moody 's right -- Sirius is right -- you 've got to get in training for the third task , straight away . And you make sure you write back to Sirius and promise him you 're not going to go sneaking off alone again . '' 
`` Let 's Stun her for a bit . Or you could use Dobby , Harry , I bet he 'd do anything to help you . I 'm not complaining or anything '' 
`` but I 'm aching all over ... '' 
`` Well , you keep missing the cushions , do n't you ! '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` You were rolling on the floor , clutching your scar ! Come now , Potter , I have experience in these matters ! '' 
`` I need to go to the hospital wing , I think , '' 
`` See you later , '' 
`` Sherbet lemon ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` Pear Drop . Er -- Licorice Wand . Fizzing Whizbee . Drooble 's Best Blowing Gum . Bertie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans ... oh no , he does n't like them , does he ? ... oh just open , ca n't you ? '' 
`` Chocolate Frog ! '' 
`` Cockroach Cluster ? '' 
`` I was only joking ... '' 
`` Come in , then . '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I did n't T CHAPTER THIRTY ` 582 ` see Madame Maxime anywhere , though , and she 'd have a job hiding , would n't she ? '' 
`` Hello , Fawkes , '' 
`` Professor ! '' 
`` Igor Karkaroff , '' 
`` There was Travers -- he helped murder the McKinnons ! Mulciber -- he specialized in the Imperius Curse , forced countless people to do horrific things ! Rookwood , who was a spy , and passed He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named useful information from inside the Ministry itself ! '' 
`` Wait , I have more ! '' 
`` Snape ! '' 
`` Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater . However , he rejoined THE PENSIEVE ` 591 ` our side before Lord Voldemort 's downfall and turned spy for us , at great personal risk . He is now no more a Death Eater than I am . '' 
`` We have heard the evidence against you , and are about to reach our verdict . Do you have anything to add to your testimony before we pronounce judgment ? '' 
`` The jury will please raise their hands ... those in favor of imprisonment ... '' 
`` I think , Harry , it is time to return to my office , '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` I know I should n't 've -- I did n't mean -- the cabinet door was sort of open and -- '' 
`` I quite understand , '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` You mean ... that stuff 's your thoughts ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` Bertha ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Well , I had a dream , '' 
`` Voldemort got a letter from an owl . He said something like , Pettigrew 's blunder had been repaired . He said someone was dead . Then he said , Pettigrew would n't be fed to the snake -- there was a snake beside his chair . He said -- he said he 'd be feeding me to it , CHAPTER THIRTY ` 600 ` instead . Then he did the Cruciatus Curse on Pettigrew -- and my scar hurt , '' 
`` Er -- that 's all , '' 
`` No , I -- how did you know it woke me up over the summer ? '' 
`` Professor ? '' 
`` I have a theory , no more than that ... It is my belief that your scar hurts both when Lord Voldemort is near you , and when he is feeling a particularly strong surge of hatred . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Just the back of his chair . But -- there would n't have been anything to see , would there ? I mean , he has n't got a body , has he ? But ... but then how could he have held the wand ? '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` do you think he 's getting stronger ? '' 
`` These disappearances seem to me to be linked . The Ministry disagrees -- as you may have heard , while waiting outside my office . '' 
`` Professor ? '' 
`` So they 're dead ? '' 
`` They are insane . They are both in St. Mungo 's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries . I believe Neville visits them , with his grandmother , during the holidays . They do not recognize him . '' 
`` The Longbottoms were very popular , '' 
`` Then Mr. Crouch 's son might not have been involved ? '' 
`` As to that , I have no idea . '' 
`` Ludo Bagman ... '' 
`` ... has never been accused of any Dark activity since , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` No more has Professor Snape , '' 
`` That , Harry , is a matter between Professor Snape and myself . '' 
`` Yes , Professor , '' 
`` And -- '' 
`` Good luck with the third task . '' 
`` And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service . One , too cowardly to return ... he will pay . One , who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed , of course ... and one , who remains my most faithful servant , and who has already reentered my service . '' 
`` Answer me ! Imperio ! '' 
`` You wo n't ? '' 
`` You can not hide from me . Does this mean you are tired of our duel ? Does this mean that you would prefer me to finish it now , Harry ? Come out , Harry ... come out and play , then ... it will be quick ... it might even be painless ... I would not know ... I have never died ... '' 
`` Expelliarmus ! '' 
`` Hold on for your father ... it will be all right ... hold on ... '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I will , '' 
`` Accio ! '' 
`` He 's back , '' 
`` Harry , let go of him , '' 
`` He wanted me to bring him back , '' 
`` What 's happened ? '' 
`` It 's all right , son , I 've got you ... come on ... hospital wing ... '' 
`` Dumbledore said stay , '' 
`` Cup was a Portkey , '' 
`` Got away ... my wand ... did something funny ... I saw my mum and dad ... they came out of his wand ... '' 
`` In here , Harry ... in here , and sit down ... You 'll be all right now ... drink this ... '' 
`` He took stuff from his father 's grave , and from Pettigrew , and me , '' 
`` Blood , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Did he forgive them ? '' 
`` There 's a Death Eater at Hogwarts ! There 's a Death Eater here -- they put my name in the Goblet of Fire , they made sure I got through to the end -- '' 
`` Karkaroff ? '' 
`` No , he did n't . It was I who did that . '' 
`` No , you did n't , '' 
`` He forgave them , then ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` It has n't been easy , Harry , guiding you through these tasks without arousing suspicion . I have had to use every ounce of cunning I possess , so that my hand would not be detectable in your success . Dumbledore would have been very suspicious if you had managed everything too easily . As long as you got into that maze , preferably with a decent head start -- then , I knew , I would have a chance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way clear . But I also had to contend with your stupidity . The second task ... that was when I was most afraid we would fail . I was keeping watch on you , Potter . I knew you had n't worked out the egg 's clue , so I had to give you another hint -- '' 
`` You did n't , '' 
`` The Dark Lord and I , '' 
`` have much in common . Both of us , for instance , had very disappointing fathers ... very disappointing indeed . Both of us suffered the indignity , Harry , of being named after those fathers . And both of us had the pleasure ... the very great pleasure ... of killing our fathers to ensure the continued rise of the Dark Order ! '' 
`` You 're mad , '' 
`` you 're mad ! '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
`` Moody , '' 
`` Of course , they would have needed to keep him alive . Harry , throw down the imposter 's cloak -- he 's freezing . Madam Pomfrey will need to see him , but he seems in no immediate danger . '' 
`` Sirius is waiting for us there . '' 
`` where are Mr. and Mrs. Diggory ? '' 
`` What happened ? '' 
`` ' Lo , Fawkes , '' 
`` Let him have a sleep . Let him rest . '' 
`` He said my blood would make him stronger than if he 'd used someone else 's , '' 
`` He said the protection my -- my mother left in me -- he 'd have it too . And he was right -- he could touch me without hurting himself , he touched my face . '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` Voldemort has overcome that particular barrier . Harry , continue , please . '' 
`` My wand 's feather came from Fawkes ? '' 
`` that some form of Cedric must have reappeared . '' 
`` He spoke to me , '' 
`` An old man , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` In reverse order . More would have appeared , of course , had you maintained the connection . Very well , Harry , these echoes , these shadows ... what did they do ? '' 
`` I assure you , he is extremely well trained . Harry -- I will wait while you get into bed . '' 
`` Is he okay ? '' 
`` He 'll be fine , '' 
`` It 's a potion for dreamless sleep . '' 
`` What are they shouting about ? Nothing else can have happened , can it ? '' 
`` And that 's Minerva Minerva McGonagall 's , is n't it ? But what are they arguing about ? '' 
`` When Dumbledore finds out -- '' 
`` The Minister has seen to that ! '' 
`` as Minister of Magic , it is my decision whether I wish to bring protection with me when interviewing a possibly dangerous -- '' 
`` you -- you ca n't seriously believe that . Voldemort -- back ? Come now , come now ... certainly , Crouch may have believed himself to be acting upon Voldemort 's orders -- but to take the word of a lunatic like that , Dumbledore ... '' 
`` You 've been reading Rita Skeeter , Mr. Fudge , '' 
`` And if I have ? '' 
`` You 'll forgive me , Dumbledore , but I 've never heard of a curse scar acting as an alarm bell before ... '' 
`` Look , I saw Voldemort come back ! '' 
`` A very old family -- donations to excellent causes -- '' 
`` Macnair ! '' 
`` It seems to me that you are all determined to start a panic that will destabilize everything we have worked for these last thirteen years ! '' 
`` Your winnings , '' 
`` One thousand Galleons . There should have been a presentation ceremony , but under the circumstances ... '' 
`` There is work to be done , '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` I must see the Diggorys . Harry -- take the rest of your potion . I will see all of you later . '' 
`` I do n't want that gold , '' 
`` You have it . Anyone can have it . I should n't have won it . It should 've been Cedric 's . '' 
`` I told him to take the cup with me , '' 
`` You look after yourself , now . '' 
`` You take this , '' 
`` Oh no , it 's yours , dear , I could n't ... you keep it . '' 
`` She went to ask him if you could come straight to us this summer , '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Good ter see yeh , mate . Good ter see yeh . '' 
`` You all righ ' ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` ' Course yeh 're not . But yeh will be . '' 
`` Yeh did as much as yer father would 've done , an ' I can ' give yeh no higher praise than that . '' 
`` What 's Dumbledore asked you to do , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Migh ' be , '' 
`` Now ... who 'd like ter come an ' visit the las ' skrewt with me ? I was jokin ' -- jokin ' ! '' 
`` He was a CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN ` 722 ` good and loyal friend , a hard worker , he valued fair play . His death has affected you all , whether you knew him well or not . I think that you have the right , therefore , to know exactly how it came about . '' 
`` Remember Cedric . Remember , if the time should come when you have to make a choice between what is right and what is easy , remember what happened to a boy who was good , and kind , and brave , because he strayed across the path of Lord Voldemort . Remember Cedric Diggory . '' 
`` It ' az been a pleasure meeting you ! '' 
`` Have you got a new headmaster yet ? '' 
`` There 's nothing in there . You can look for yourself , but there 's nothing at all . I 've been checking every day . Just a small piece the day after the third task saying you won the tournament . They did n't even mention Cedric . Nothing about any of it . If you ask me , Fudge is forcing them to keep quiet . '' 
`` He 'll never keep Rita quiet , '' 
`` How was she doing it ? '' 
`` Did I ? '' 
`` I caught her on the windowsill in the hospital wing . Look very closely , and you 'll notice the markings around her antennae are exactly like those foul glasses she wears . '' 
`` Get out , '' 
`` Me , '' 
`` You going to tell us , then ? '' 
`` Bagman ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` How ? '' 
`` So that 's why he kept trying to help me win ! '' 
`` Take it , '' 
`` No , I 'm not , '' 
`` Listen , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` take it , or I 'll hex you . I know some good ones now . Just do me one favor , okay ? Buy Ron some different dress robes and say they 're from you . '' 
`` I think Dumbledore will let you come to us later in the summer . Keep in touch , Harry . '' 
`` We 're not allowed to talk about it , do n't ask me anything , '' 
`` the Chosen One , '' 
`` Are n't -- are n't we leaving , sir ? '' 
`` Please sit down . '' 
`` Oh . Right . '' 
`` is that Sirius also left you number twelve , Grimmauld Place . '' 
`` You can keep using it as headquarters , '' 
`` I do n't care . You can have it , I do n't really want it . '' 
`` I bet there has , '' 
`` I do n't care , '' 
`` Wo n't , wo n't , wo n't , wo n't -- '' 
`` Kreacher , shut up ! '' 
`` Do I -- do I have to keep him with me ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` yeah , I 'll do that . Er -- Kreacher -- I want you to go to Hogwarts and work in the kitchens there with the other house-elves . '' 
`` There is also the matter of the hippogriff , Buckbeak . Hagrid has been looking after him since Sirius died , but Buckbeak is yours now , so if you would prefer to make different arrangements -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` he can stay with Hagrid . I think Buckbeak would prefer that . '' 
`` I 'll just go and -- er -- finish off , '' 
`` Professor -- I 'm ready now . '' 
`` Bye , '' 
`` We do not want to be encumbered by these just now , '' 
`` I shall send them to the Burrow to await us there . However , I would like you to bring your Invisibility Cloak ... just in case . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` So you will need to hold on to my arm very tightly . My left , if you do n't mind -- as you have noticed , my wand arm is a little fragile at the moment . '' 
`` Well , here we go . '' 
`` I 'm fine , '' 
`` Your scar ... has it been hurting at all ? '' 
`` Well , I 'm not complaining , '' 
`` Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry . In any case , most Wizarding dwellings are magically protected from unwanted Apparators . At Hogwarts , for instance -- '' 
`` -- you ca n't Apparate anywhere inside the buildings or grounds , '' 
`` Is he ... Do you think he 's good ? '' 
`` I know what you meant . Rufus is a man of action and , having fought Dark wizards for most of his working life , does not underestimate Lord Voldemort . '' 
`` I did n't ... '' 
`` Er ... right , '' 
`` Dead bodies that have been bewitched to do a Dark wizard 's bidding . Inferi have not been seen for a long time , however , not since Voldemort was last powerful ... He killed enough people to make an army of them , of course . This is the place , Harry , just here ... '' 
`` Oh dear . Oh dear , dear , dear . '' 
`` Maybe there was a fight and -- and they dragged him off , Professor ? '' 
`` Hmpf , '' 
`` Here -- '' 
`` I am undoubtedly slower than I was . But on the other hand ... '' 
`` Idiotic woman . Never liked her . '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` Do n't think I do n't know why he 's brought you , '' 
`` Yeah , I 've been told , '' 
`` Except for your eyes . You 've got -- '' 
`` My mother 's eyes , yeah . '' 
`` do n't go holding that against me ! You 'll be Gryffindor like her , I suppose ? Yes , it usually goes in families . Not always , though . Ever heard of Sirius Black ? You must have done -- been in the papers for the last couple of years -- died a few weeks ago -- '' 
`` Well , anyway , he was a big pal of your father 's at school . The whole Black family had been in my House , but Sirius ended up in Gryffindor ! Shame -- he was a talented boy . I got his brother , Regulus , when he came along , but I 'd have liked the set . '' 
`` One of my best friends is Muggle-born , '' 
`` and she 's the best in our year . '' 
`` You must n't think I 'm prejudiced ! '' 
`` No , no , no ! Have n't I just said your mother was one of my all-time favorite students ? And there was Dirk Cresswell in the year after her too -- now Head of the Goblin Liaison Office , of course -- another Muggle-born , a very gifted student , and still gives me excellent inside information on the goings-on at Gringotts ! '' 
`` All ex-students , all signed . You 'll notice Barnabas Cuffe , editor of the Daily Prophet , he 's always interested to hear my take on the day 's news . And Ambrosius Flume , of Honeydukes -- a hamper every birthday , and all because I was able to give him an introduction to Ciceron Harkiss , who gave him his first job ! And at the back -- you 'll see her if you just crane your neck -- that 's Gwenog Jones , who of course captains the Holyhead Harpies ... People are always astonished to hear I 'm on first-name terms with the Harpies , and free tickets whenever I want them ! '' 
`` And all these people know where to find you , to send you stuff ? '' 
`` I have been out of touch with everybody for a year . '' 
`` Still ... the prudent wizard keeps his head down in such times . All very well for Dumbledore to talk , but taking up a post at Hogwarts just now would be tantamount to declaring my public allegiance to the Order of the Phoenix ! And while I 'm sure they 're very admirable and brave and all the rest of it , I do n't personally fancy the mortality rate -- '' 
`` You do n't have to join the Order to teach at Hogwarts , '' 
`` Most of the teachers are n't in it , and none of them has ever been killed -- well , unless you count Quirrell , and he got what he deserved seeing as he was working with Voldemort . '' 
`` I reckon the staff are safer than most people while Dumbledore 's headmaster ; he 's supposed to be the only one Voldemort ever feared , is n't he ? '' 
`` Well , yes , it is true that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has never sought a fight with Dumbledore , '' 
`` I do love knitting patterns . Well , Harry , we have trespassed upon Horace 's hospitality quite long enough ; I think it is time for us to leave . '' 
`` Bye , '' 
`` I did n't do anything , '' 
`` Er ... '' 
`` likes his comfort . He also likes the company of the famous , the successful , and the powerful . He enjoys the feeling that he influences these people . He has never wanted to occupy HORACE SLUGHORN ` 75 ` the throne himself ; he prefers the backseat -- more room to spread out , you see . He used to handpick favorites at Hogwarts , sometimes for their ambition or their brains , sometimes for their charm or their talent , and he had an uncanny knack for choosing those who would go on to become outstanding in their various fields . Horace formed a kind of club of his favorites with himself at the center , making introductions , forging useful contacts between members , and always reaping some kind of benefit in return , whether a free box of his favorite crystalized pineapple or the chance to recommend the next junior member of the Goblin Liaison Office . '' 
`` This will do , Harry . If you will grasp my arm . '' 
`` I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it , Harry , but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry . Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you . '' 
`` It 's just hard , '' 
`` to realize he wo n't write to me again . '' 
`` Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before , '' 
`` Naturally , the loss is devastating ... '' 
`` But while I was at the Dursleys ' ... '' 
`` I realized I ca n't shut myself away or -- or crack up . Sirius would n't have wanted that , would he ? And anyway , life 's too short ... Look at Madam Bones , look at Emmeline Vance ... It could be me next , could n't it ? But if it is , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I think they ought to know . You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them . '' 
`` Or perhaps , to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened ? You need your friends , Harry . As you so rightly said , Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away . '' 
`` On a different , though related , subject , it is my wish that you take private lessons with me this year . '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` because they were a -- '' 
`` Well , that means I wo n't see much of Professor Snape from now on , '' 
`` because he wo n't let me carry on Potions unless I get ` Outstanding ' in my O.W.L. , which I know I have n't . '' 
`` Yeah , I am , '' 
`` Sit down , dear , I 'll knock something up . '' 
`` So Hermione 's here ? '' 
`` So you persuaded Horace Slughorn to take the job ? '' 
`` He was at Hogwarts for ages , started around the same time as Dumbledore , I think . Did you like him ? '' 
`` That 's great ! '' 
`` Is Mr. Weasley still at work ? '' 
`` What do you like me to call you when we 're alone together ? '' 
`` No , we got wind of a nasty backfiring jinx down in Elephant and Castle , but luckily the Magical Law Enforcement Squad had sorted it out by the time we got there ... '' 
`` ’N ight , Mr. Weasley , '' 
`` We did n't know you were here already ! '' 
`` Never been better , '' 
`` Same as usual , '' 
`` What 's the time ? Have I missed breakfast ? '' 
`` You did ? '' 
`` He looks a bit like a walrus , and he used to be Head of Slytherin , '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` She 's so full of herself . '' 
`` Who are you -- ? '' 
`` Oh ... is she here too ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Do n't you get used to her if she 's staying in the same house ? '' 
`` How 's she going to manage that ? '' 
`` Fleur 's not stupid , she was good enough to enter the Triwizard Tournament , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I was just saying , Phlegm -- I mean , Fleur -- '' 
`` I 'd much rather have Tonks in the family , '' 
`` She still has n't got over what happened ... you know ... I mean , he was her cousin ! '' 
`` How does she work that one out ? '' 
`` I did n't know that could happen , '' 
`` Your mum said the shop 's going well , '' 
`` And what about Percy ? '' 
`` He 's going to be giving me private lessons this year , '' 
`` I only just remembered , '' 
`` You know , the one they were trying to steal at the Ministry . '' 
`` The Prophet 's got it right , '' 
`` That glass ball that smashed was n't the only record of the prophecy . I heard the whole thing in Dumbledore 's office , he was the one the prophecy was made to , so he could tell me . From what it said , '' 
`` it looks like I 'm the one who 's got to finish off Voldemort ... At least , it said neither of us could live while the other survives . '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` Not as much as I was , '' 
`` I wonder what he 'll teach you , Harry ? Really advanced defensive magic , probably ... powerful countercurses ... anti-jinxes ... '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` I 'm going to see whether any owls have come ... '' 
`` What happens if we fail ? '' 
`` We discuss our options with our Head of House , I asked Professor Minerva McGonagall at the end of last term . '' 
`` And there are three of them , '' 
`` Outstanding '' 
`` Here -- swap -- '' 
`` Mum , are there any more sausages ? '' 
`` The man who ran -- '' 
`` -- the ice-cream place in Diagon Alley ? '' 
`` Thanks , Bill , '' 
`` He 's been given top-grade security status . And we 'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too . '' 
`` Ah , good , he 's here ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Buckbeak -- Witherwings , I mean -- yeh should see him , Harry , he 's so happy ter be back in the open air -- '' 
`` Glad he 's pleased , '' 
`` Let 's get goin ' then -- after yeh , Molly , Arthur -- '' 
`` ... not a child , in case you have n't noticed , Mother . I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping alone . '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` Really , you should n't accuse -- dangerous thing to say -- wands away , please ! '' 
`` I see that being Dumbledore 's favorite has given you a false sense of security , Harry Potter . But Dumbledore wo n't always be there to protect you . '' 
`` I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius . '' 
`` Just about , '' 
`` Bu ' they wouldn ' dare make trouble in the middle o ' Diagon Alley , Harry . Don ' worry abou ' them . '' 
`` This is brilliant ! '' 
`` that really is extraordinary magic ! '' 
`` Handy , '' 
`` I ca n't do that ! '' 
`` Wonder where his mummy is ? '' 
`` Get under here , quick , '' 
`` He was going in that direction , '' 
`` Quick , or we 'll lose him , '' 
`` It does n't matter , '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` The thing is , that -- er -- boy who was in here just now , Draco Malfoy , well , he 's a friend of mine , and I want to get him a birthday present , but if he 's already reserved anything , I obviously do n't want to get him the same thing , so ... um ... '' 
`` But what about when he said , ` Do n't forget to keep that one safe ' ? '' 
`` Yeah , I do , '' 
`` That 's my point , I do n't know ! '' 
`` But he 's up to something and I think we should take it seriously . His father 's a Death Eater and -- '' 
`` He 's a Death Eater , '' 
`` He showed Borgin something we could n't see , '' 
`` I 'll be careful not to slip in it . '' 
`` Is Tonks going to be there ? '' 
`` I can walk , thanks , '' 
`` Oh yeah , I forgot , '' 
`` Mr. Weasley , can I have a quick word ? '' 
`` When we were in Diagon Alley , '' 
`` Because I thought Malfoy was up to something , '' 
`` He went into Borgin and Burkes , '' 
`` and started bullying the bloke in there , Borgin , to help him fix something . And he said he wanted Borgin to keep something else for him . He made it sound like it was the same kind of thing that needed fixing . Like they were a pair . And ... '' 
`` I think you missed something , '' 
`` -- stay safe ! '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Neville ! '' 
`` Quibbler still going strong , then ? '' 
`` Let 's find seats , '' 
`` They 're staring at you because you were at the Ministry too , '' 
`` Cherry and unicorn hair , '' 
`` We think it was one of the last Ollivander ever sold , he vanished next day -- oi , come back here , Trevor ! '' 
`` No point now we 've got rid of Umbridge , is there ? '' 
`` They 're friends of mine , '' 
`` You are cool , '' 
`` You did . You should hear my gran talk about you . ` That Harry Potter 's got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together ! ' She 'd give anything to have you as a grandson ... '' 
`` Hi , Neville . Hi , Luna . Guess what ? '' 
`` Malfoy 's not doing prefect duty . He 's just sitting in his compartment with the other Slytherins , we saw him when we passed . '' 
`` It makes you lucky ! '' 
`` Sir , I think you knew my grandfather , Abraxas Malfoy ? '' 
`` The clear winner ! '' 
`` Excellent , excellent , Harry ! Good lord , it 's clear you 've inherited your mother 's talent . She was a dab hand at Potions , Lily was ! Here you are , then , here you are -- one bottle of Felix Felicis , as promised , and use it well ! '' 
`` Got lucky , I suppose , '' 
`` I s ' pose you think I cheated ? '' 
`` Slughorn could 've handed me that book , but no , I get the one no one 's ever written on . Puked on , by the look of page fifty-two , but -- '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` It 's nothing , '' 
`` Hey ! '' 
`` Finished ? '' 
`` Good . Then I 'll have it back , '' 
`` The Half-Blood Prince , he was called , '' 
`` Acid Pops , '' 
`` Good evening , sir , '' 
`` Yes , thanks , sir , '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` You said , at the end of last term , you were going to tell me everything , '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` But you think you 're right ? '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` does what you 're going to tell me have anything to do with the prophecy ? Will it help me ... survive ? '' 
`` and I certainly hope that it will help you to survive . '' 
`` You look worried . '' 
`` Sir -- how did you injure your hand ? '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' 
`` Why ca n't Ogden -- ? '' 
`` Get in the house . Do n't argue . '' 
`` The Imperius Curse ? '' 
`` What went wrong ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` Around that time , yes , Harry . '' 
`` We 'll go down after Quidditch , '' 
`` Everyone knows you 've been telling the truth now , do n't they ? The whole Wizarding world has had to admit that you were right about Voldemort being back and that you really have fought him twice in the last two years and escaped both times . And now they 're calling you ` the Chosen One ' -- well , come on , ca n't you see why people are fascinated by you ? '' 
`` Ha ! '' 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
`` I 'm keeping it ! Look , I 've thought it out -- '' 
`` Diffindo ! '' 
`` Reparo ! '' 
`` Excellent , who ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Stan Shunpike , a Death Eater ? '' 
`` Yeah , that 's him , '' 
`` Have n't you noticed ? His seat 's been empty as often as Hagrid 's this past week . '' 
`` Tom ? You 've got a visitor . This is Mr. Dumberton -- sorry , Dunderbore . He 's come to tell you -- well , I 'll let him do it . '' 
`` He believed it much quicker than I did -- I mean , when you told him he was a wizard , '' 
`` Did you know -- then ? '' 
`` The ring 's gone , '' 
`` Very astute , Harry , but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ . '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` So how was Slughorn 's latest party ? '' 
`` But obviously if you 'd rather I hooked up with McLaggen ... '' 
`` Reparo , '' 
`` It says we 're supposed to puncture them with something sharp ... '' 
`` Well then , you 're in , '' 
`` I can fix that , '' 
`` And Ginny , do n't call Ron a prat , you 're not the Captain of this team -- '' 
`` Well , you seemed too busy to call him a prat and I thought someone should -- '' 
`` In the air , everyone , let 's go ... '' 
`` Good work , everyone , I think we 'll flatten Slytherin , '' 
`` No , you did n't , '' 
`` You 're the best Keeper I tried out , Ron . Your only problem is nerves . '' 
`` He does n't mean anything , Ginny -- '' 
`` You -- '' 
`` C’mon , '' 
`` betrayal of trust '' 
`` supposed to be my friend '' 
`` D’you think Hermione did snog Krum ? '' 
`` Dilligrout , '' 
`` You 're not pathetic and you 're not resigning ! '' 
`` I know you have n't got any time to find another Keeper , so I 'll play tomorrow , but if we lose , and we will , I 'm taking myself off the team . '' 
`` Tea ? '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Do n't drink that , Ron ! '' 
`` Excuse me ? '' 
`` I do n't know what you 're talking about , '' 
`` Hark who 's talking , '' 
`` Nearly time , '' 
`` Pretty lucky the weather 's this good , eh ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` They 're playing Harper instead ; he 's in my year and he 's an idiot . '' 
`` My drink ... my pumpkin juice ... you did n't ... ? '' 
`` We 'll be starting in about five minutes , you 'd better get your boots on . '' 
`` Mount your brooms . On the whistle ... three ... two ... one ... '' 
`` Oh , and here comes Slytherin 's first attempt on goal , it 's Urquhart streaking down the pitch and -- '' 
`` -- Weasley saves it , well , he 's bound to get lucky sometimes , I suppose ... '' 
`` That 's right , Smith , he is , '' 
`` Thinks he 's something special today , does n't he ? '' 
`` And I think Harper of Slytherin 's seen the Snitch ! '' 
`` How much did Malfoy pay you to come on instead of him ? '' 
`` YES ! '' 
`` Ginny , where 're you going ? '' 
`` What are you two talking about ? '' 
`` No , I did n't , '' 
`` I did n't put it in ! '' 
`` I wanted Ron to think I 'd done it , so I faked it when I knew you were looking . '' 
`` But the weather 's good ... and Vaisey could n't play ... I honestly have n't been given lucky potion ? '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` shall ... shall we go up to the party , then ? '' 
`` He 's over there , the filthy hypocrite . '' 
`` Yeah ... they 're -- er -- really good ... '' 
`` Er ... does he ? '' 
`` She snogged Krum . So she 's found out someone wants to snog me too . Well , it 's a free country . I have n't done anything wrong . '' 
`` I mean , all right , I was going to go to Slughorn 's Christmas party with her , but she never said ... just as friends ... I 'm a free agent ... '' 
`` Krum '' 
`` ca n't complain '' 
`` For the last time , '' 
`` Why did n't you confiscate them then ? '' 
`` There is n't anyone I want to invite , '' 
`` Hang on a moment , '' 
`` I do n't go around putting potions in people 's drinks ... or pretending to , either , which is just as bad ... '' 
`` Yeah , well , never mind that , '' 
`` Come on , why not ? '' 
`` Easy for you to say , '' 
`` It is n't the library 's , it 's mine ! '' 
`` It 's just a book that 's been written on ! '' 
`` Baubles , '' 
`` No thanks , '' 
`` Oh -- right -- thanks a lot , '' 
`` Er -- I 'm just going over here with ... '' 
`` I thought at first it was Moaning Myrtle in there , but it turned out to be Hermione . She said something about that Ron Weasley ... '' 
`` Yeah , they 've had a row , '' 
`` I s ' pose , '' 
`` How would you like to come to Slughorn 's party with me tonight ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` We 're supposed to bring guests , so I thought you might like ... I mean ... '' 
`` I mean , just as friends , you know . But if you do n't want to ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` that was a mistake . I 'll get Hermione to put it right for me . So , I 'll meet you in the entrance hall at eight o’clock then . '' 
`` Potty asked Loony to go to the party ! Potty lurves Loony ! Potty luuuuurves Looooooony ! '' 
`` Potty loves Loony ! '' 
`` Nice to keep these things private , '' 
`` You could say sorry , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Slughorn 's office , '' 
`` I -- what ? '' 
`` Father wrote a very long article about it when Scrimgeour first took over from Cornelius Fudge , but he was forced not to publish by somebody from the Ministry . Obviously , they did n't want the truth to get out ! '' 
`` Harry , m ' boy ! '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` were you ? '' 
`` My dear boy , the gold you could make , you have no idea -- '' 
`` I 'm definitely not interested , '' 
`` and I 've just seen a friend of mine , sorry . '' 
`` What 's happened to you ? '' 
`` Serves you right for coming with him , '' 
`` You considered Smith ? '' 
`` Do you really think I 'd stoop that low ? '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` No , sorry , '' 
`` Oh , hello , '' 
`` Instinctive , you know -- like his mother ! I 've only ever taught a few with this kind of ability , I can tell you that , Sybill -- why even Severus -- '' 
`` Yeah , well , that 's what I 'd like to do , '' 
`` The Aurors are part of the Rotfang Conspiracy , I thought everyone knew that . They 're working to bring down the Ministry of Magic from within using a combination of Dark Magic and gum disease . '' 
`` Said you were the best potion-maker he 'd ever known ... '' 
`` I 'll be back in a bit , Luna -- er -- bathroom . '' 
`` I 'm not trying to conceal anything from him , I just do n't want you butting in ! '' 
`` I was very lucky to collect this , '' 
`` As you will understand when we have experienced it . Shall we ? '' 
`` Where is Marvolo ? '' 
`` Is that all ? '' 
`` And so , for the first time , I am giving you homework , Harry . It will be your job to persuade Professor Slughorn to divulge the real memory , which will undoubtedly be our most crucial piece of information of all . '' 
`` But surely , sir , '' 
`` you do n't need me -- you could use Legilimency ... or Veritaserum ... '' 
`` Professor Slughorn is an extremely able wizard who will be expecting both , '' 
`` I tell my friends what I 'm up to , if I want them to keep a lookout for me , '' 
`` How exactly did it happen , Harry ? '' 
`` Lucky there was one in the room , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Probably , '' 
`` but why would Slughorn want to poison Ron ? '' 
`` Dumbledore reckons Voldemort wanted Slughorn on his side , '' 
`` Slughorn was in hiding for a year before he came to Hogwarts . And ... '' 
`` Not bad , '' 
`` That 's just what we were discussing , '' 
`` Oh , Harry , what can we say ? You saved Ginny ... you saved Arthur ... now you 've saved Ron ... '' 
`` Do n't be ... I did n't ... '' 
`` Well , CHAPTER NINETEEN ` 404 ` all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express , Harry . '' 
`` is how long Hogwarts can stay open if kids are bein ' attacked . Chamber o ' Secrets all over again , isn ' it ? There 'll be panic , more parents takin ' their kids outta school , an ' nex ' thing yeh know the board o ' governors ... '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Look at the time , it 's gettin ' on fer midnight , I need ter -- '' 
`` Hagrid , why is Dumbledore angry with Snape ? '' 
`` Do n't try and make me feel guilty , it wo n't work ! '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Yeah , but Dumbledore 's not having rows with the rest of them , is he ? '' 
`` Must 've fallen asleep . Look , I saw them taking Weasley up to the hospital wing earlier . Did n't look like he 'll be fit for next week 's match . '' 
`` Oh ... right ... Quidditch , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yeah , I suppose so ... '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Look , why do n't you talk to Ron about all this ? '' 
`` Is he ? '' 
`` Yeah , I think so . Well , they 're friends , are n't they ? '' 
`` Would you call getting poisoned being interesting ? '' 
`` Anyway -- sorry , got to go -- there 's McLaggen coming for a talk about Quidditch , '' 
`` I 've told you , '' 
`` he could be world-class and I would n't want to keep him . He keeps trying to tell everyone what to do , he thinks he could play every position better than the rest of us . I ca n't wait to be shot of him . And speaking of getting shot of people , '' 
`` will you stop pretending to be asleep when Lavender comes to see you ? She 's driving me mad as well . '' 
`` If you do n't want to go out with her anymore , just tell her , '' 
`` Hermione going to look in before the match ? '' 
`` I 'll try , '' 
`` See you after the match . '' 
`` I met Malfoy , '' 
`` Well , I 'm not likely to find out , am I ? '' 
`` Come on then ! '' 
`` Coote , Peakes , you 'll want to fly out of the sun , so they do n't see you coming -- '' 
`` I 'm the Captain , McLaggen , shut up giving them instructions , '' 
`` Make sure you do fly out of the sun , '' 
`` He did the commentary last time , of course , and Ginny Weasley flew into him , I think probably on purpose , it looked like it . Smith was being quite rude about Gryffindor , I expect he regrets that now he 's playing them -- oh , CHAPTER NINETEEN ` 414 ` look , he 's lost the Quaffle , Ginny took it from him , I do like her , she 's very nice ... '' 
`` McLaggen , will you pay attention to what you 're supposed to be doing and leave everyone else alone ! '' 
`` I do n't think that 'll help him find the Snitch , but maybe it 's a clever ruse ... '' 
`` Oh , look ! The Gryffindor Keeper 's got hold of one of the Beater 's bats . '' 
`` Will you give him back his bat and get back to the goal posts ! '' 
`` Cracked skull , '' 
`` I do n't want to stay here overnight , '' 
`` D’you know how much we lost by ? '' 
`` Brilliant , '' 
`` I hope Luna always commentates from now on ... Loser 's Lurgy ... '' 
`` Oh ... '' 
`` Yeah ... well , I saw Malfoy sneaking off with a couple of girls who did n't look like they wanted to be with him , and that 's the second time he 's made sure he is n't down on the Quidditch pitch with the rest of the school ; he skipped the last match too , remember ? '' 
`` I want to know what he 's up to , '' 
`` but there 's no rule saying only one person at a time can be plotting anything in this place ! You 're getting a bit obsessed with Malfoy , Harry . I mean , thinking about missing a match just to follow him ... '' 
`` I want to catch him at it ! '' 
`` What 's going -- ? '' 
`` Muffliato ! '' 
`` Langlock ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Okay then , '' 
`` Yeah , I did , '' 
`` Come to think of it , it would be good to have both of you , '' 
`` I want to know where he 's going , who he 's meeting , and what he 's doing . I want you to follow him around the clock . '' 
`` There wo n't be any need for that , '' 
`` That 's the one , '' 
`` And you 're forbidden to tip him off , Kreacher , or to show him what you 're up to , or to talk to him at all , or to write him messages or ... or to contact him in any way . Got it ? '' 
`` What did they row about ? '' 
`` Never mind her , '' 
`` Yeah , well , there was no need for Ginny and Dean to split up over it , '' 
`` I just do n't want my Quidditch team messed up again ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Tonight , '' 
`` C’mon , '' 
`` Thanks a lot , Hermione , '' 
`` Professor Trelawney still is n't happy Firenze is teaching , then ? '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` -- which , naturally , made you forget all about trying to retrieve the memory ; I would have expected nothing else , while your best friend was in danger . Once it became clear that Mr. Weasley was going to make a full recovery , however , I would have hoped that you returned to the task I set you . I thought I made it clear to you how very important that memory is . Indeed , I did my best to impress upon you that it is the most crucial memory of all and that we will be wasting our time without it . '' 
`` I see . '' 
`` Professor Dumbledore , I 'm really sorry . I should have done more ... I should have realized you would n't have asked me to do it if it was n't really important . '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' 
`` Voldemort killed his father and his grandparents and made it look as though his Uncle Morfin did it . Then he went back to Hogwarts and he asked ... he asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes , '' 
`` Thus far , as I hope you agree , I have shown you reasonably firm sources of fact for my deductions as to what Voldemort did until the age of seventeen ? '' 
`` How did you feel about that , sir ? '' 
`` Which job did he want , sir ? What subject did he want to teach ? '' 
`` And now for the very last recollection I have to show you , at least until you manage to retrieve Professor Slughorn 's memory for us . Ten years separates Hokey 's memory and this one , ten years during which we can only guess at what Lord Voldemort was doing ... '' 
`` I heard that you had become headmaster , '' 
`` And what will become of those whom you command ? What will happen to those who call themselves -- or so rumor has it -- the Death Eaters ? '' 
`` The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a CHAPTER TWENTY ` 446 ` burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes . But I wish I could , Tom ... I wish I could ... '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` When you have that last piece of the jigsaw , everything will , I hope , be clear ... to both of us . '' 
`` Do n't start , Hermione , '' 
`` Sectumsempra ! '' 
`` I 've only done it once , '' 
`` There 's only THE UNKNOWABLE ROOM ` 449 ` one way to force someone to do what you want , and that 's the Imperius Curse , which is illegal -- '' 
`` Yeah , I know that , thanks , '' 
`` Why do n't you ditch her if you want to finish it ? '' 
`` You and Cho just -- '' 
`` Sort of fell apart , yeah , '' 
`` Wish that would happen with me and Lavender , '' 
`` Can I borrow your quill for the conclusion ? '' 
`` Kreacher ! '' 
`` Dobby has been helping too , Harry Potter ! '' 
`` What 's going on , Harry ? '' 
`` Well ... they 've been following Malfoy for me , '' 
`` You have n't slept , Dobby ? But surely , Harry , you did n't tell him not to -- '' 
`` No , of course I did n't , '' 
`` Dobby , you can sleep , all right ? But has either of you found out anything ? '' 
`` A bad boy who -- who -- '' 
`` Dobby still finds it difficult to speak ill of his old masters ... '' 
`` Yeah , we do n't need to hear about you being in love with Malfoy , '' 
`` The Room of Requirement ! '' 
`` Dobby , have you managed to get in to have a look at what Malfoy 's doing ? '' 
`` No , it 's not , '' 
`` There 'll be a way around that , '' 
`` How good 's this ? '' 
`` How many people are in on it ? You would n't think he 'd trust lots of them to know what he 's doing ... '' 
`` Yeah , that is weird , '' 
`` I heard him telling Crabbe it was n't Crabbe 's business what he was doing ... so what 's he telling all these ... all these ... '' 
`` God , I 've been stupid , '' 
`` Polyjuice Potion . He stole some of the Polyjuice Potion Slughorn showed us in our first Potions lesson ... There are n't a whole variety of students standing guard for Malfoy ... it 's just Crabbe and Goyle as usual ... Yeah , it all fits ! '' 
`` Yeah , of course ! '' 
`` Well , they would n't , would they , if he 's shown them his Dark Mark ? '' 
`` We 'll see , '' 
`` that what you 're supposed to be concentrating on is getting that memory from Slughorn . Good night . '' 
`` I 'd have that Apparition Test in the bag . '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` you should go and find Slughorn and start appealing to his better nature . '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` Okay ... I thought the wrong thing ... '' 
`` I need to see what Draco Malfoy is doing inside you '' 
`` Ten points from Gryffindor . '' 
`` I thought Snape and Mundungus were on the same side , '' 
`` Let us ask Potter how we would tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost . '' 
`` Yeah , ghosts are transparent , but Inferi are dead bodies , are n't they ? So they 'd be solid -- '' 
`` You might as well do the extra practice sessions in Hogsmeade and see where they get you , '' 
`` and I have n't seen you for months and months . I 've learned not to expect too much from boys . '' 
`` I thought you lived in that girls ' bathroom ? '' 
`` Vividly , '' 
`` There 's been a boy in here crying ? '' 
`` I 've been trying ! '' 
`` I solemnly swear that I am up to no good , '' 
`` OUCH ! '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` His office is n't here , '' 
`` it 's round the other side of the castle , behind the gargoyle -- '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Has he ? '' 
`` I just thought he might know what 's going on ... I 've heard rumors ... people getting hurt ... '' 
`` Yeah , I know , it 's all been in the papers , '' 
`` No one from the Order writes to me anymore , '' 
`` not since Sirius -- '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` Well ... I 'll see you around , Harry ... '' 
`` Good one , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` I had a thought , '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` but she was nearly crying when I mentioned his name ... and her Patronus is a big fourlegged thing now ... I wondered whether it had n't become ... you know ... him . '' 
`` they 're easily upset . '' 
`` Thanks ... '' 
`` Dumbledore said we would n't be having any more lessons until I got the memory ! '' 
`` We 've been down to see him by night before , '' 
`` You did n't meet him , Hermione . Believe me , being dead will have improved him a lot . '' 
`` It 's such a pointless thing to get detention for . '' 
`` Yeah , I know , '' 
`` Fifty-seventh time lucky , you think ? '' 
`` Of course ! Why did n't I think of it ? '' 
`` Felix Felicis ? '' 
`` He died ? '' 
`` What was the werewolf 's name ? '' 
`` I knew it -- the maniac who likes attacking kids , the one Lupin told me about ! '' 
`` You 'll do fine , '' 
`` Well , now , this looks absolutely wonderful , '' 
`` Euphoria , I take it ? And what 's that I smell ? Mmmm ... you 've added just a sprig of peppermint , have n't you ? Unorthodox , but what a stroke of inspiration , Harry , of course , that would tend to counterbalance the occasional side effects of excessive singing and nose-tweaking ... I really do n't know where you get these brain waves , my boy ... unless -- '' 
`` Oh ... yeah , maybe , '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` Professor -- Professor , do n't you want to taste my po -- ? '' 
`` No joy , '' 
`` Yeah , I s ' pose I 'd better , '' 
`` Well , here goes , '' 
`` Excellent , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Trust me , '' 
`` I know what I 'm doing ... or at least '' 
`` Felix does . '' 
`` You 're always doing that , I can get through perfectly well on my own ... '' 
`` I think Filch must 've forgotten to lock the doors , '' 
`` Well , sir , it 's Hagrid , '' 
`` Well , I ca n't promise that , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` But AFTER THE BURIAL ` 481 ` acromantula venom is very valuable ... If the beast only just died it might not yet have dried out ... Of course , I would n't want to do anything insensitive if Hagrid is upset ... but if there was any way to procure some ... I mean , it 's almost impossible to get venom from an acromantula while it 's alive ... '' 
`` ... seems an awful waste not to collect it ... might get a hundred Galleons a pint ... To be frank , my salary is not large ... '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` well , if you wanted to come , Professor , Hagrid would probably be really pleased ... Give Aragog a better send-off , you know ... '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' 
`` Yeah -- Ron and Hermione could n't , though , '' 
`` Where are we burying him ? '' 
`` yes '' 
`` It wasn ' easy , gettin ' Aragog 's body out o ' there , I can tell yeh -- they usually eat their dead , see ... But I wanted ter give ' im a nice burial ... a proper send-off ... '' 
`` Professor Slughorn met me coming down here , Hagrid . '' 
`` Yeh shouldn ' be outta the castle in the evenin ' , I know it , it 's my fault -- '' 
`` No , no , when he heard what I was doing he said he 'd like to come and pay his last respects to Aragog too , '' 
`` I still do n't understand , '' 
`` Well , he did n't want his hard work to be wasted , '' 
`` So he 's made himself impossible to kill by murdering other people ? '' 
`` He made seven Horcruxes ? '' 
`` But the six Horcruxes , then , '' 
`` how are we supposed to find them ? '' 
`` You have ? '' 
`` No doubt he thought that Lucius would not dare do anything with the Horcrux other than guard it carefully , but he was counting too much upon Lucius 's fear of a master who had been gone for years and whom Lucius believed dead . Of course , Lucius did not know what the diary really was . I understand that Voldemort had told him the diary would cause the Chamber of Secrets to reopen because it was cleverly enchanted . Had Lucius known he held a portion of his master 's soul in his hands , he would undoubtedly have treated it with more reverence -- but instead he went ahead and carried out the old plan for his own ends : By planting the diary upon Arthur Weasley 's daughter , he hoped to discredit Arthur and get rid of a highly incriminating magical object in one stroke . Ah , poor Lucius ... what with Voldemort 's fury about the fact that he threw away the Horcrux for his own gain , and the fiasco at the Ministry last year , I would not be surprised if he is not secretly glad to be safe in Azkaban at the moment . '' 
`` So if all of his Horcruxes are destroyed , Voldemort could be killed ? '' 
`` But I have n't got uncommon skill and power , '' 
`` I know ! '' 
`` So , when the prophecy says that I 'll have ` power the Dark Lord knows not , ' it just means -- love ? '' 
`` You are setting too much store by the prophecy ! '' 
`` But , '' 
`` but you said the prophecy means -- '' 
`` If Voldemort had never heard of the prophecy , would it have been fulfilled ? Would it have meant anything ? Of course not ! Do you think every prophecy in the Hall of Prophecy has been fulfilled ? '' 
`` But , '' 
`` but last year , you said one of us would have to kill the other -- '' 
`` Harry , Harry , only because Voldemort made a grave error , and acted on Professor Trelawney 's words ! If Voldemort had never murdered your father , would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge ? Of course not ! If he had not forced your mother to die for you , would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate ? Of course not , Harry ! Do n't you see ? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy , just as tyrants everywhere do ! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress ? All of them realize that , one day , amongst their many victims , there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back ! Voldemort is no different ! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him . He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action , with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him , he handed him uniquely deadly weapons ! '' 
`` Of course I have n't ! '' 
`` I 'm fine , '' 
`` I 've got to be quick , '' 
`` Dumbledore thinks I 'm getting my Invisibility Cloak . Listen ... '' 
`` ... so you see what this means ? '' 
`` Dumbledore wo n't be here tonight , so Malfoy 's going to have another clear shot at whatever he 's up to . No , listen to me ! '' 
`` I have n't got time to argue , '' 
`` Take this as well -- '' 
`` I 'll be fine , I 'll be with Dumbledore , '' 
`` I want to know you lot are okay ... Do n't look like that , Hermione , I 'll see you later ... '' 
`` Very good . Shall we go ? '' 
`` But what will people think when they see you leaving , Professor ? '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` will we be Apparating ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but I have n't got a license . '' 
`` As long as nobody sees us go ... now place your hand upon my arm , Harry . There is no need to grip too hard , I am merely guiding you . On the count of three ... One ... two ... three ... '' 
`` They brought the kids from the orphanage here ? '' 
`` There is a village of sorts about halfway along the cliffs behind us . I believe the orphans H CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX ` 556 ` were taken there for a little sea air and a view of the waves . No , I think it was only ever Tom Tom Riddle and his youthful victims who visited this spot . No Muggle could reach this rock unless they were uncommonly good mountaineers , and boats can not approach the cliffs , the waters around them are too dangerous . I imagine that Tom Riddle climbed down ; magic would have served better than ropes . And he brought two small children with him , probably for the pleasure of terrorizing them . I think the journey alone would have done it , do n't you ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` How can you tell ? '' 
`` We go on through here . The entrance is concealed . '' 
`` You 've d-done it ! '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` that we are required to make payment to pass . '' 
`` Payment ? '' 
`` Yeah , but still , if you can avoid it ... '' 
`` Professor ! '' 
`` Professor ? '' 
`` We could n't ... we could n't just try a Summoning Charm ? '' 
`` Me ? Oh ... okay ... '' 
`` Accio Horcrux ! '' 
`` Something , I think , that is ready to respond should we attempt to seize the Horcrux . '' 
`` But we do n't know what the thing was , '' 
`` Yes , I think so . '' 
`` So sorry , Harry , I should have given warning . Stand back against the wall , please ; I think I have found the place . '' 
`` How did you know that was there ? '' 
`` But why have they let us ? '' 
`` I think he would have been prepared to risk what was , to his mind , the most unlikely possibility that somebody else would find it , knowing that he had set other obstacles ahead that only he would be able to penetrate . We shall see whether he is right . '' 
`` I do not think you will count , Harry : You are underage and unqualified . Voldemort would never have expected a sixteen-year-old to reach this place : I think it unlikely that your powers will register compared to mine . '' 
`` Professor ! '' 
`` So that thing that jumped out of the water -- ? '' 
`` There are bodies in here ! '' 
`` At the moment ? '' 
`` There is nothing to be feared from a body , Harry , any more than there is anything to be feared from the darkness . Lord Voldemort , who of course secretly fears both , disagrees . But once again he reveals his own lack of wisdom . It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness , nothing more . '' 
`` But one of them jumped , '' 
`` Oh ... right ... '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` See ? I can not approach any nearer than this . You try . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Lord Voldemort would not want to kill the person who reached this island . '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` sir , this is Voldemort we 're -- '' 
`` I 'm sorry , Harry ; I should have said , he would not want to immediately kill the person who reached this island , '' 
`` He would want to keep them alive long enough to find out how they managed to penetrate so far through his defenses and , most importantly of all , why they were so intent upon emptying the basin . Do not forget that Lord Voldemort believes that he alone knows about his Horcruxes . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but -- '' 
`` Well , then , '' 
`` Why ca n't I drink the potion instead ? '' 
`` I -- all right , but -- '' 
`` Professor ? '' 
`` Professor Dumbledore ? '' 
`` Professor , can you hear me ? '' 
`` I do n't want ... Do n't make me ... '' 
`` You ... you ca n't stop , Professor , '' 
`` You 've got to keep drinking , remember ? You told me you had to keep drinking . Here ... '' 
`` I do n't want to ... I do n't want to ... Let me go ... '' 
`` It 's all right , Professor , '' 
`` Yes ... yes , this 'll make it stop , '' 
`` It 's all right , Professor , it 's all right ! '' 
`` It 's all my fault , all my fault , '' 
`` Please make it stop , I know I did wrong , oh please make it stop and I 'll never , never again ... '' 
`` This will make it stop , Professor , '' 
`` Do n't hurt them , do n't hurt them , please , please , it 's my fault , hurt me instead ... '' 
`` Here , drink this , drink this , you 'll be all right , '' 
`` No more , please , no more ... '' 
`` We 're nearly there , Professor . Drink this , drink it ... '' 
`` This -- this one will ! '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Water , '' 
`` But I had some -- wait -- Aguamenti ! '' 
`` Sir , I 'm trying , I 'm trying ! '' 
`` Sir -- here ! '' 
`` Petrificus Totalus ! '' 
`` Petrificus Totalus ! '' 
`` Sectumsempra ! SECTUMSEMPRA ! '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` sir , I forgot -- about fire -- they were coming at me and I panicked -- '' 
`` Quite understandable , '' 
`` Do n't worry , sir , '' 
`` One alone could not have done it ... You did well , very well , Harry ... '' 
`` Do n't talk now , '' 
`` Save your energy , sir ... We 'll soon be out of here ... '' 
`` The archway will have sealed again ... My knife ... '' 
`` There 's no need , I got cut on the rock , '' 
`` Just tell me where ... '' 
`` Here ... '' 
`` It 's going to be all right , sir , '' 
`` We did it , Professor ! '' 
`` That potion ... was no health drink ... '' 
`` He 's hurt , '' 
`` Yeh can ' stay here , Harry ... Come on , now ... '' 
`` No . '' 
`` I 'm not hurt , '' 
`` Everyone 's up there , Ron and Hermione and Lupin and everyone -- '' 
`` He stepped over Bill , but it 's all right , he 's alive . '' 
`` Snape killed him , '' 
`` -- more Death Eaters arrived -- and then Snape -- and Snape did it . The Avada Kedavra . '' 
`` Harry , what happened ? According to Hagrid you were with Professor Dumbledore when he -- when it happened . He says Professor Snape was involved in some -- '' 
`` Snape killed Dumbledore , '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Snape passed Voldemort the information that made Voldemort hunt down my mum and dad . Then Snape told Dumbledore he had n't realized what he was doing , he was really sorry he 'd done it , sorry that they were dead . '' 
`` Dumbledore believed Snape was sorry James was dead ? Snape hated James ... '' 
`` And he did n't think my mother was worth a damn either , '' 
`` because she was Muggle-born ... ` Mudblood , ' he called her ... '' 
`` So when he arrived at the fight , he joined in on the Death Eaters ' side ? '' 
`` It 's all so confusing ... Dumbledore had told us that he would be leaving the school for a few hours and that we were to patrol the corridors just in case ... Remus , Bill , and Nymphadora were to join us ... and so we patrolled . All seemed quiet . Every secret passageway out of the school was covered . We knew nobody could fly in . There were powerful enchantments on every entrance into the castle . I still do n't know how the Death Eaters can possibly have entered ... '' 
`` I do , '' 
`` So they got in through the Room of Requirement . '' 
`` To set off the Mark ? '' 
`` So if Ron was watching the Room of Requirement with Ginny and Neville , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` So then he came upstairs , '' 
`` After all -- he was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ... I just assumed that he was in a hurry to chase after the Death Eaters who 'd escaped up to the tower ... '' 
`` He was , '' 
`` but to help them , not to stop them ... and I 'll bet you had to have a Dark Mark to get through that barrier -- so what happened when he came back down ? '' 
`` We thought they were being chased by the Death Eaters -- and next thing , the other Death Eaters and Greyback were back and we were fighting again -- I thought I heard Snape shout something , but I do n't know what -- '' 
`` He shouted , ` It 's over , ' '' 
`` I am sure zat will be lovely . '' 
`` Before I meet them I would like a quick word with you , Harry . If you 'll come with me ... '' 
`` See you in a bit '' 
`` I ca n't tell you that , Professor , '' 
`` It is , '' 
`` very , but he did n't want me to tell anyone . '' 
`` Potter '' 
`` in the light of Professor Dumbledore 's death , I think you must see that the situation has changed somewhat -- '' 
`` I do n't think so , '' 
`` Bill and Fleur 's wedding , remember ? '' 
`` Yeah , we should n't miss that , '' 
`` He 's got so many little friends , he 's so popular ... '' 
`` And finally , Bungy the budgie has found a novel way of keeping cool this summer . Bungy , who lives at the Five Feathers in Barnsley , has learned to water-ski ! Mary Dorkins went to find out more ... '' 
`` Get -- off -- me ! '' 
`` Did you hear that car backfire just now ? Gave Petunia and me quite a turn ! '' 
`` What do I mean by what ? '' 
`` Making a racket like a starting pistol right outside our -- '' 
`` I did n't make that noise , '' 
`` Listening to the news , '' 
`` Well , it changes every day , you see , '' 
`` ... that your lot do n't get on our news ! '' 
`` That 's all you know , '' 
`` -- owls -- doing if they 're not bringing you news ? '' 
`` Get out of that one , boy ! As if we did n't know you get all your news from those pestilential birds ! '' 
`` The owls ... are n't bringing me news , '' 
`` Well , that 's news to me , '' 
`` We ca n't say much about you-know-what , obviously ... '' 
`` We 've been told not to say anything important in case our letters go astray ... '' 
`` We 're quite busy but I ca n't give you details here ... '' 
`` There 's a fair amount going on , we 'll tell you everything when we see you ... '' 
`` See ya , Big D ! '' 
`` How long have you been ` Big D’ then ? '' 
`` Cool name , '' 
`` So who 've you been beating up tonight ? '' 
`` That -- that thing you 're hiding . '' 
`` Not as stupid as you look , are you , Dud ? But I s ' pose if you were , you would n't be able to walk and talk at the same time ... '' 
`` What d’you mean , I 'm not brave in bed ? '' 
`` What d’you mean ? '' 
`` I -- you 're lying -- '' 
`` Shut up , '' 
`` I c-can ' t see ! I 've g-gone blind ! I -- '' 
`` I said shut up ! '' 
`` I 'll t-tell Dad ! '' 
`` Will you shut up ? '' 
`` I 'm trying to lis -- '' 
`` You moron , Dudley ! '' 
`` DUDLEY , KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ! WHATEVER YOU DO , KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT ! Wand ! '' 
`` Where 's -- wand -- come on -- Lumos ! '' 
`` Expecto Patronum ! '' 
`` Bow to death , Harry ... It might even be painless ... I would not know ... I have never died ... '' 
`` THIS WAY ! '' 
`` DUDLEY ? DUDLEY ! '' 
`` Do n't put it away , idiot boy ! '' 
'' Harry looked down at the piece of paper . The narrow handwriting was vaguely familiar . It said : The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve , Grimmauld Place , London . C H A P T E R F O U R ` 59 ` NUMBER TWELVE , GRIMMAULD PLACE hat 's the Order of the -- ? '' 
`` Wait till we 're inside ! '' 
`` But do n't go far inside and do n't touch anything . '' 
`` He 's just arrived , the meeting 's started ... '' 
`` Hedwig ! '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` Hermione was going spare , she kept saying you 'd do something stupid if you were stuck all on your own without news , but Dumbledore made us -- '' 
`` -- swear not to tell me , '' 
`` Yeah , Hermione 's already said . '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Yeah ? '' 
`` Well , no -- but that 's why he 's had people from the Order of the Phoenix tailing you all the time -- '' 
`` Did n't work that well , though , did it ? '' 
`` Well , I 'm glad he left , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` So why 's Dumbledore been so keen to keep me in the dark ? '' 
`` Did you -- er -- bother to ask him at all ? '' 
`` We did , mate . But he 's really busy now , we 've only seen him twice since we came here and he did n't have much time , he just NUMBER TWELVE , GRIMMAULD PLACE ` 65 ` made us swear not to tell you important stuff when we wrote , he said the owls might be intercepted -- '' 
`` He could still 've kept me informed if he 'd wanted to , '' 
`` Maybe he thinks I ca n't be trusted , '' 
`` So how come I have to stay at the Dursleys ' while you two get to join in everything that 's going on here ? '' 
`` SO YOU HAVE N'T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS , BIG DEAL ! YOU 'VE STILL BEEN HERE , HAVE N'T YOU ? YOU 'VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER ! ME , I 'VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS ' FOR A MONTH ! AND I 'VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO 'VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT -- WHO SAVED THE SORCERER 'S STONE ? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE ? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS ? '' 
`` You 're absolutely right , Harry -- I 'd be furious if it was me ! '' 
`` What is this place anyway ? '' 
`` Who 's in it ? '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Voldemort ! '' 
`` Could n't have been me , could it ? '' 
`` You two passed your Apparation tests , then ? '' 
`` Snape ? '' 
`` Is Bill here ? '' 
`` Could n't Percy do that ? '' 
`` What 's happened ? '' 
`` You 're kidding ? '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` But what 's this got to do with Percy ? '' 
`` I 'm coming to that . Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family -- and Dumbledore . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` And it got worse . He said Dad was an idiot to run around with Dumbledore , that Dumbledore was heading for big trouble and Dad was going to go down with him , and that he -- Percy -- knew where his loyalty lay and it was with the Ministry . And if Mum and Dad were going to become traitors to the Ministry he was going to make sure everyone knew he did n't belong to our family anymore . And he packed his bags the same night and left . He 's living here in London now . '' 
`` But Percy must know Voldemort 's back , '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` Yeah , I have ! '' 
`` Not cover to cover , '' 
`` Which is what ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` They keep slipping in snide comments about you . If some far-fetched story appears they say something like ` a tale worthy of Harry Potter ' and if anyone has a funny accident or anything it 's ` let 's hope he has n't got a scar on his forehead or we 'll be asked to worship him next -- ' '' 
`` I do n't want anyone to worship -- '' 
`` I did n't ask -- I did n't want -- Voldemort killed my parents ! '' 
`` Look ... '' 
`` Who 's Kreacher ? '' 
`` Dammit , '' 
`` Shut up , you horrible old hag , shut UP ! '' 
`` Hello , Harry , '' 
`` I see you 've met my mother . '' 
`` Interrogators : Cornelius Oswald Fudge , Minister of Magic ; Amelia Susan Bones , Head of the Department of Magical Law En - THE HEARING ` 139 ` forcement ; Dolores Jane Umbridge , Senior Undersecretary to the Minister . Court Scribe , Percy Ignatius Weasley -- '' 
`` -- Witness for the defense , Albus Dumbledore Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but I only used it because we were -- '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` because -- '' 
`` A corporeal Patronus ? '' 
`` A -- what ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` it 's a stag , it 's always a stag . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I 've been doing it for over a year -- '' 
`` And you are fifteen years old ? '' 
`` Yes , Professor Lupin taught me in my third year , because of the -- '' 
`` Impressive , '' 
`` a true Patronus at that age ... very impressive indeed . '' 
`` I did it because of the dementors ! '' 
`` I 'm not lying ! '' 
`` We do , in fact , have a witness to the presence of dementors in that alleyway , '' 
`` other than Dudley Dursley , I mean . '' 
`` They were big . Big and wearing cloaks . '' 
`` That 's what you saw , is it ? '' 
`` That was n't me , it was a house-elf ! '' 
`` And those in favor of conviction ? '' 
`` Very well , very well ... cleared of all charges . '' 
`` Well , I must be getting along . Good day to you all . '' 
`` Dumbledore did n't say -- '' 
`` Cleared , '' 
`` of all charges ! '' 
`` you were tried by the full court ? '' 
`` I think so , '' 
`` Morning , Arthur , '' 
`` We have had two changes in staffing this year . We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank , who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons ; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge , our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher . '' 
`` And to see such happy little faces looking back at me ! '' 
`` Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school , and that is as it should be , for without progress there will be stagnation and decay . There again , progress for progress 's sake must be discouraged , for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering . A balance , then , between old and new , between permanence and change , between tradition and innovation ... '' 
`` Did it ? '' 
`` See you later , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Not bad , '' 
`` Me mam did n't want me to come back . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` But -- why ? '' 
`` What d’you mean ? '' 
`` she ... er ... well , it 's not just you , it 's Dumbledore too ... '' 
`` She believes the Daily Prophet ? '' 
`` Yeah , something like that . '' 
`` What are you asking me for ? '' 
`` I 'll have a go at anyone who calls me a liar , '' 
`` I 'll talk to you how I want , '' 
`` That 's before she started believing every word the stinking Daily Prophet writes about me ! '' 
`` My gran 's always said Voldemort would come back one day . She says if Dumbledore says he 's back , he 's back . '' 
`` Does he think he 'll turn into a nutter if he stays in a room with me too long ? '' 
`` Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I 'm a lying , attention-seeking prat , have you ? '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` Do n't you remember what Dumbledore said at the end-of-term feast last year ? '' 
`` Yeah , we really ought to be trying to make friends with people like that , '' 
`` Dumbledore did n't even mention how long that Grubbly-Plank woman 's staying , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Nice one , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` I s ' pose , '' 
`` What are you still getting that for ? '' 
`` You 're going to need all the ingredients and materials -- and premises too , I suppose ... '' 
`` They bought me a new set of dress robes this summer , and I could n't understand where they got the Galleons ... '' 
`` D’you know what you want to do after Hogwarts ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Yeah , it would , '' 
`` An Auror 's worthwhile ! '' 
`` I mean , if I could take S.P.E.W. further ... '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` So did you ... er ... have a good summer ? '' 
`` It means they 're not real fans , they 're just jumping on the bandwagon -- '' 
`` That 's the bell , '' 
`` I take only the very best into my N.E.W.T. Potions class , which means that some of us will certainly be saying good-bye . '' 
`` What use is that ? '' 
`` And what good 's theory going to be in the real world ? '' 
`` Oh yeah ? '' 
`` Hmm , let 's think ... '' 
`` maybe Lord Voldemort ? '' 
`` You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead -- '' 
`` He was n't dead , '' 
`` but yeah , he 's returned ! '' 
`` It is NOT a lie ! '' 
`` So , according to you , Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord , did he ? '' 
`` It was murder , '' 
`` Oooh , Crackpot 's feeling cranky , '' 
`` I said , leave me ALONE ! '' 
`` I 've been sent to see you , '' 
`` Sent ? What do you mean , sent ? '' 
`` Is what true ? '' 
`` Professor ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` And sit down . '' 
`` Potter , you need to be careful . '' 
`` But I was telling the truth ! '' 
`` No , thanks , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Pur-lease ... '' 
`` What I do n't get , '' 
`` is why they all believed the story two months ago when Dumbledore told them ... '' 
`` The thing is , Harry , I 'm not sure they did , '' 
`` What d’you mean , you 're not sure they believed Dumbledore ? '' 
`` Which is the truth ! '' 
`` Well , we 've never had great Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , have we ? '' 
`` Do n't start arguing again , '' 
`` No -- come on , Hermione -- we ca n't tell them off for giving out sweets ... '' 
`` You know perfectly well that those are bits of Nosebleed Nougat or -- or Puking Pastilles or -- '' 
`` Fainting Fancies ? '' 
`` She 's got it under control , '' 
`` There 's no point trying to finish this now , I ca n't do it without Hermione , I have n't got a clue what you 're supposed to do with moonstones , have you ? '' 
`` I 'm going to bed too . '' 
`` the stupid great oaf 's got himself badly injured . '' 
`` Maybe you will if you do n't shut up , '' 
`` OUCH ! '' 
`` If he calls Hagrid a moron one more time ... '' 
`` Wow , I wonder what it 'd be like to have a difficult life ? '' 
`` I just wish Hagrid would hurry up and get back , that 's all , '' 
`` And do n't say that Grubbly-Plank woman 's a better teacher ! '' 
`` Because she 'll never be as good as Hagrid , '' 
`` Er -- right , '' 
`` D’you mind not offending the only people who believe me ? '' 
`` Ginny 's told me all about her , apparently she 'll only believe in things as long as there 's no proof at all . Well , I would n't expect anything else from someone whose father runs The Quibbler . '' 
`` Er -- thanks very much , Ernie , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I did n't decide not to be there ! '' 
`` You know what ? '' 
`` Less than zero , '' 
`` Better try , though , had n't I ? I 'll offer to do two more detentions or something , I dunno ... '' 
`` I hope she does n't keep me too long this evening . You realize we 've got to write three essays , practice Vanishing Spells for Minerva McGonagall , work out a countercharm for Flitwick , finish the bowtruckle drawing , and start that stupid dream diary for Trelawney ? '' 
`` Good evening , Harry Potter . '' 
`` Evening , '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` Well I 'm ... I 'm on the Gryffindor Quidditch team . And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was -- was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it -- do it another night ... instead ... '' 
`` Oh no , no , no . This is your punishment for spreading evil , nasty , attention-seeking stories , Harry Potter , and punishments certainly can not be adjusted to CHAPTER THIRTEEN ` 266 ` suit the guilty one 's convenience . No , you will come here at five o’clock tomorrow , and the next day , and on Friday too , and you will do your detentions as planned . I think it rather a good thing that you are missing something you really want to do . It ought to reinforce the lesson I am trying to teach you . '' 
`` How many times ? '' 
`` You have n't given me any ink , '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` Come here , '' 
`` Well , we 'll just have to try again tomorrow evening , wo n't we ? You may go . '' 
`` How come you did n't do it last night ? '' 
`` doing other stuff , '' 
`` That 'll have to do , '' 
`` I 've said I dreamed I was buying a new pair of shoes , she ca n't make anything weird out of that , can she ? '' 
`` How was detention with Umbridge , anyway ? What did she make you do ? '' 
`` Lines . '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I 'm in detention ! '' 
`` It 's not as if it 's a dreadful punishment , really ... '' 
`` Good evening '' 
`` Good night . '' 
`` I must not tell lies '' 
`` Er -- nothing . What are you doing ? '' 
`` But what have you got your broom for , you have n't been flying , have you ? '' 
`` I 'm not laughing , '' 
`` I wish I was going to be there , '' 
`` Yeah , so do -- Harry , what 's that on the back of your hand ? '' 
`` I thought you said she was giving you lines ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I do n't know how much power Minerva McGonagall 's got over her , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` He 's got enough on his mind , '' 
`` Well , I think I 've made my point , Harry Potter . You may go . '' 
`` Mimbulus mimbletonia ! '' 
`` What ? Oh -- brilliant ! '' 
`` I was up until one o’clock making more hats . They 're disappearing like mad ! '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` it 's a possibility , is n't it ? '' 
`` But I do n't think he can be possessing her the way he possessed Quirrell , I mean , he 's properly alive again now , is n't he , he 's got his own body , he would n't need to share someone else 's . He could have her under the Imperius Curse , I suppose ... '' 
`` She 's evil , '' 
`` She 's horrible , yes , but ... Harry , I think you ought to tell Dumbledore your scar hurt . '' 
`` I 'm not bothering him with this . Like you just said , it 's not a big deal . It 's been hurting on and off all summer -- it was just a bit worse tonight , that 's all -- '' 
`` Harry , I 'm sure Dumbledore would want to be bothered by this -- '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` that 's the only bit of me Dumbledore cares about , is n't it , my scar ? '' 
`` All right , all right , I wo n't tell him , then ! '' 
`` Er ... no , I do n't think I will , thanks , '' 
`` Er -- not tomorrow . I 've got loads of homework to do ... '' 
`` Does it involve Paracelsus falling on top of the person 's head ? '' 
`` Subtlety has never been Peeves 's strong point . I 'm off to try and find the Bloody Baron ... He might be able to put a stop to it ... See you , Harry ... '' 
`` Yeah , ' bye , '' 
`` I 'm not doing anything wrong , '' 
`` There you are , '' 
`` Right , I know this says ` Snuffles ' on the outside , '' 
`` Safe flight , then , '' 
`` Oh ... hi , '' 
`` I did n't think anyone would be up here this early ... I only remembered five minutes ago , it 's my mum 's birthday . '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Nice day , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Hey , has Gryffindor got a new Keeper yet ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` I think so . I did n't see his tryout , though , I was in detention . '' 
`` That Umbridge woman 's foul , '' 
`` Putting you in detention just because you told the truth about how -- how -- how he died . Everyone heard about it , it was all over the school . You were really brave standing up to her like that . '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
`` I 've had a tip-off that you are intending to place a massive order for Dungbombs ! '' 
`` I ca n't , it 's gone . '' 
`` Gone , '' 
`` If I get so much as a whiff of a Dungbomb ... '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Morning , '' 
`` Erm ... Quidditch later , '' 
`` Yeah , okay , '' 
`` What 's happened ? '' 
`` Dumbledore did warn him not to . '' 
`` Hey ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` look ... this little piece here ... '' 
`` Six months in Azkaban ! '' 
`` Wait a moment ... '' 
`` Sturgis was supposed to come and see us off , remember ? '' 
`` The Ministry suspects he 's one of Dumbledore 's lot so -- I dunno -- they lured him to the Ministry , and he was n't trying to get through a door at all ! Maybe they 've just made something up to get him ! '' 
`` I mean , we can do it tonight , '' 
`` And we 've got tomorrow . She gets too worked up about work , that 's her trouble ... '' 
`` D’you think she meant it when she said we were n't copying from her ? '' 
`` Yeah , I do , '' 
`` And we have got plenty of time to do it all ... '' 
`` Let 's get to it ; Alicia and Fred , if you can just bring the ball crate out for us . Oh , and there are a couple of people out there watching but I want you to just ignore them , all right ? '' 
`` Ignore them , '' 
`` He 's just nervous , '' 
`` What now ? '' 
`` It was -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Well , I suppose he could 've played better , '' 
`` but it was only the first training session , like you said ... '' 
`` Gryffindor are losers '' 
`` You know , we probably should try and get more homework done during the week , '' 
`` Listen ... shall we just ask Hermione if we can have a look at what she 's done ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` you know she wo n't let us . '' 
`` Thanks a million , Hermione , '' 
`` Okay , write that down , '' 
`` Harry , yours is okay except for this bit at the end , I think you must have misheard Professor Sinistra , Europa 's covered in ice , not mice -- Harry ? '' 
`` Because I 've just seen Sirius 's head in the fire , '' 
`` You 've been popping into the fire every hour ? '' 
`` This was the only way I could come up with of answering Harry 's letter without resorting to a code -- and codes are breakable . '' 
`` I forgot , '' 
`` Yeah , and Dumbledore said it happened whenever Voldemort was feeling a powerful emotion , '' 
`` So you do n't think it had anything to do with Umbridge touching me when I was in detention with her ? '' 
`` I know her by reputation and I 'm sure she 's no Death Eater -- '' 
`` She 's foul enough to be one , '' 
`` Does Lupin know her ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Trained in combat ? '' 
`` Madame Maxime was with him , we 've been in touch with her and she says they got separated on the journey home -- but there 's nothing to suggest he 's hurt or -- well , nothing to suggest he 's not perfectly okay . '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` I would , I just do n't want you chucked back in Azkaban ! '' 
`` I ca n't believe this . It 's outrageous ... '' 
`` I know it is , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Still , better than D , is n't it ? ` Dreadful ' ? '' 
`` What was it like ? '' 
`` Angelina 'll do her nut if you miss any more Quidditch practices . '' 
`` Think of a dream , quick , '' 
`` Oh , I dunno ... '' 
`` It does n't matter , pick any of them , '' 
`` I dunno , last night , whenever you like , '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` I am here to teach you using a Ministryapproved method that does not include inviting students to give their opinions on matters about which they understand very little . Your previous teachers in this subject may have allowed you more license , but as none of them -- with the possible exception of Professor Quirrell , who did at least appear to have restricted himself to age-appropriate subjects -- would have passed a Ministry inspection -- '' 
`` Yeah , Quirrell was a great teacher , '' 
`` there was just that minor drawback of him having Lord Voldemort sticking out of the back of his head . '' 
`` From Professor Umbridge , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` But -- what ? Professor , no ! '' 
`` she 's bang out of order . '' 
`` You think Minerva McGonagall was right , do you ? '' 
`` Right then , everyone , listen closely -- Dean Thomas , if you do that to the mouse again I shall put you in detention -- most of you have now successfully vanished your snails and even those who were left with a certain amount of shell have the gist of the spell . Today we shall be -- '' 
`` As I was saying , the Vanishing Spell becomes more difficult with the complexity of the animal to be vanished . The snail , as an invertebrate , does not present much of a challenge ; the mouse , as a mammal , THE HOGWARTS HIGH INQUISITOR ` 321 ` offers a much greater one . This is not , therefore , magic you can accomplish with your mind on your dinner . So -- you know the incantation , let me see what you can do ... '' 
`` How she can lecture me about not losing my temper with Umbridge ! '' 
`` You do not usually take this class , is that correct ? '' 
`` I am a substitute teacher standing in for Professor Hagrid . '' 
`` I wonder -- the headmaster seems strangely reluctant to give me any information on the matter -- can you tell me what is causing Professor Hagrid 's very extended leave of absence ? '' 
`` Only because he was too stupid to listen to what Hagrid told him to do , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Minerva McGonagall would go nuts if she knew -- '' 
`` Yeah , she probably would , '' 
`` I was thinking that -- maybe the time 's come when we should just -- just do it ourselves . '' 
`` Do what ourselves ? '' 
`` If you 're talking about Lupin ... '' 
`` Who , then ? '' 
`` About me what ? '' 
`` I 'm talking about you teaching us Defense Against the Dark Arts . '' 
`` What 's an idea ? '' 
`` But ... '' 
`` Me ? '' 
`` Let 's think , '' 
`` But that was luck , '' 
`` that was n't skill -- '' 
`` Second year , '' 
`` Do n't sit there grinning like you know better than I do , I was there , was n't I ? '' 
`` Please ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` In ... in a minute . I 'll just clear this up . '' 
`` Reparo , '' 
`` ' Course I have , '' 
`` oh , all right , the idea I had , then -- about you teaching us . '' 
`` yeah , I -- I 've thought about it a bit . '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` Well , what do you think ? Will you teach us ? '' 
`` Well ... now , do n't fly off the handle again , Harry , please ... But I really think you ought to teach anyone who wants to learn . I mean , we 're talking about defending ourselves against V-Voldemort -- oh , do n't be pathetic , Ron -- it does n't seem fair if we do n't offer the chance to other people . '' 
`` Yeah , but I doubt anyone except you two would want to be taught by me . I 'm a nutter , remember ? '' 
`` until V-Voldemort -- oh for heaven 's sake , Ron -- comes out into the open , Sirius is going to have to stay hidden , is n't he ? I mean , the stupid Ministry is n't going to realize Sirius is innocent until they accept that Dumbledore 's been telling the truth about him all along . And once the fools start catching real Death Eaters again it 'll be obvious Sirius is n't one ... I mean , he has n't got the Mark , for one thing . '' 
`` Dumbledore 'd go mad if he did and Sirius listens to Dumbledore even if he does n't like what he hears . '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` I suppose he was checking for the smell of Dungbombs , '' 
`` I forgot to tell you ... '' 
`` I dunno , '' 
`` Where are we going anyway ? '' 
`` I do n't know about this , Hermione , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` especially as it 's not exactly a homework group you 're planning , is it ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Six Sickles , '' 
`` I 'll get them , '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` So who did you say is supposed to be meeting us ? '' 
`` A couple of people ? '' 
`` Cough up , everyone , I have n't got enough gold for all of these ... '' 
`` Well -- er -- hi . '' 
`` Well ... erm ... well , you know why you 're here . Erm ... well , Harry here had the idea -- I mean '' 
`` I had the idea -- that it might be good if people who wanted to study Defense Against the Dark Arts -- and I mean , really study it , you know , not the rubbish that Umbridge is doing with us '' 
`` And by that I mean learning how to defend ourselves properly , not just theory but the real spells -- '' 
`` You want to pass your Defense Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. too though , I bet ? '' 
`` What makes me say Voldemort 's back ? '' 
`` I saw him . But Dumbledore told the whole school what happened last year , and if you did n't believe him , IN THE HOG 'S HEAD ` 341 ` you do n't believe me , and I 'm not wasting an afternoon trying to convince anyone . '' 
`` If you 've come to hear exactly what it looks like when Voldemort murders someone I ca n't help you , '' 
`` that you can produce a Patronus ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` A corporeal Patronus ? '' 
`` Er -- you do n't know Madam Bones , do you ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` She 's not wrong , '' 
`` That 's what one of the portraits on the wall told me when I was in there last year ... '' 
`` Er -- yeah , I did , yeah , '' 
`` all the tasks he had to get through in the Triwizard Tournament last year -- getting past dragons and merpeople and acromantulas and things ... '' 
`` That was a seriously cool bit of flying ... '' 
`` Yeah , well -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` no , okay , I know I did bits of it without help , but the point I 'm trying to make is -- '' 
`` Are you trying to weasel out of showing us any of this stuff ? '' 
`` why do n't you shut your mouth ? '' 
`` Personally I think this is really important , possibly more important than anything else we 'll do this year , even with our O.W.L.s coming up ! '' 
`` I , personally , am at a loss to see why the Ministry has foisted such a useless teacher upon us at this critical period . Obviously they are in denial about the return of Voldemort , but to give us a teacher who is trying to actively prevent us from using defensive spells -- '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I ca n't see Madam Pince being too chuffed with us doing jinxes in the library , '' 
`` And if this list was found ... well , I mean to say ... you said yourself , if Umbridge finds out ... '' 
`` You just said this group was the most important thing you 'd do this year , '' 
`` What d’you mean ? '' 
`` This is n't a coincidence , '' 
`` Or -- I thought that Michael Corner had a really shifty look too -- '' 
`` I wonder if Hermione 's seen this yet ? '' 
`` Er -- I do n't think we 're allowed in the girls ' dormitories , '' 
`` Oooh , who tried to get upstairs ? '' 
`` It 's okay , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Okay , okay , '' 
`` Oh , I 've always loved that owl , she 's so beautiful , '' 
`` She 's hurt ! '' 
`` Professor Binns , '' 
`` Not at all well , '' 
`` Yes ... yes , hospital wing ... well , off you go , then , Perkins ... '' 
`` You should be in class , sunny Jim . '' 
`` This is urgent , '' 
`` Well , that 's put us in our place , has n't it ? '' 
`` No , Professor ! '' 
`` I 'm looking for Professor Grubbly-Plank , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Looks like something 's attacked her . Ca n't think what would have done it , though ... Thestrals will sometimes go for birds , of course , but Hagrid 's got the Hogwarts thestrals well trained not to touch owls ... '' 
`` Do you know how far this owl 's traveled , Potter ? '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` From London , I think . '' 
`` Er -- right -- thanks , '' 
`` Oh yeah ! '' 
`` I -- '' 
`` To Grubbly-Plank , '' 
`` And I met Minerva McGonagall ... Listen ... '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Snuffles , '' 
`` I just hope nobody else has read this ... '' 
`` But it was still sealed and everything , '' 
`` Neville , no ! '' 
`` Help me ! '' 
`` Ten points from Gryffindor . Release Longbottom , Potter , or it will be detention . Inside , all of you . '' 
`` I had to stop you , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Ha , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I just think she 's an absolutely appalling teacher and a real old fraud ... But Harry 's already missed History of Magic and I do n't think he ought to miss anything else today ! '' 
`` ... may well choose to leave ... the indignity of it ... on probation ... we shall see ... how she dares ... '' 
`` You and Umbridge have got something in common , '' 
`` Please turn to page thirty-four of Defensive Magical Theory and read the third chapter , entitled ` The Case for Non-Offensive Responses to Magical Attack . ' There will be -- '' 
`` -- no need to talk , '' 
`` But I kept my temper ! '' 
`` She 's given the Slytherins permission , why not us ? '' 
`` That 's a bright side , is it ? '' 
`` No Quidditch practice and extra Potions ? '' 
`` Just go and stop them , then ! '' 
`` You know , I do n't get why Fred and George only got three O.W.L.s each , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Not that good , '' 
`` That was Mundungus ? '' 
`` I 'm still being followed ? '' 
`` You do ? '' 
`` Hermione , this whole thing was your idea ! '' 
`` Hear , hear , '' 
`` Well , that 's a bit of a problem now , '' 
`` Well , I 'm sure you 'll come up with somewhere ... There used to be a pretty roomy secret passageway behind that big mirror on the fourth floor , you might have enough space to practice jinxes in there -- '' 
`` Fred and George told me it 's blocked , '' 
`` Sirius ? '' 
`` What ! '' 
`` But he 's all for it ! '' 
`` Yes , that 's what made me think maybe it was n't a good idea after all ... '' 
`` Let 's get this straight , '' 
`` Sirius agrees with us , so you do n't think we should do it anymore ? '' 
`` Yes , I do ! '' 
`` What d’you mean , ` living through us ' ? '' 
`` Hermione did it , '' 
`` Impervius ! '' 
`` OUCH ! '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` I -- poked myself in the eye , that 's all ... '' 
`` Was it your scar ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` He 's probably miles away . It hurt because ... he 's ... angry . '' 
`` Did you ... get a vision , or something ? '' 
`` He wants something done , and it 's not happening fast enough , '' 
`` When your scar hurt in Umbridge 's office ? Voldemort was angry ? '' 
`` What is it , then ? '' 
`` Last time , it was because he was pleased , '' 
`` Really pleased . CHAPTER EIGHTEEN ` 382 ` He thought ... something good was going to happen . And the night before we came back to Hogwarts ... '' 
`` I 'm not making prophecies , '' 
`` Harry , you 're reading Voldemort 's mind ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Ca n't , can I ? '' 
`` Well then , Dumbledore -- '' 
`` I 've just told you , he already knows , '' 
`` Dumbledore 'd want to know , '' 
`` C’mon ... we 've still got Silencing Charms to practice ... '' 
`` Harry Potter , sir ! '' 
`` Whozair ? '' 
`` Dobby ? '' 
`` Thanks , Dobby ! '' 
`` Yeah , how is Winky ? '' 
`` Winky is still drinking lots , sir , '' 
`` Not really bad , '' 
`` Dobby wishes he could help Harry Potter , for Harry Potter set Dobby free and Dobby is much , much happier now ... '' 
`` You ca n't help me , Dobby , but thanks for the offer ... '' 
`` Wait a moment -- there is something you can do for me , Dobby , '' 
`` I need to find a place where twenty-eight people can practice Defense Against the Dark Arts without being discovered by any of the teachers . Especially , '' 
`` Professor Umbridge . '' 
`` Dobby knows the perfect place , sir ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` -- and if you really needed a bathroom , '' 
`` How many people know about it ? '' 
`` It sounds brilliant , '' 
`` We could go now , if you like ! '' 
`` Not tonight , Dobby , '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` because we 've found somewhere to have our first Defense meeting . Tonight , eight o’clock , seventh floor opposite that tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy being clubbed by those trolls . Can you tell Katie and Alicia ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Just in passing , '' 
`` Hold it , '' 
`` I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . '' 
`` Filch is on the second floor , '' 
`` and Mrs. Norris is on the fourth . '' 
`` In her office , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` What is this place ? '' 
`` Dark Detectors , '' 
`` Basically they all show when Dark wizards or enemies are around , but you do n't want to rely on them too much , they can be fooled ... '' 
`` Well , I 've been thinking about the sort of stuff we ought to do first and -- er -- '' 
`` Er -- right , thanks , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` I 've used it against him , '' 
`` But if you think it 's beneath you , you can leave , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` I reckon we should all divide into pairs and practice . '' 
`` You can practice with me , '' 
`` Good one ! '' 
`` Listen , Neville , can you take it in turns to practice with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing ? '' 
`` Could n't resist ... '' 
`` Okay , stop ! '' 
`` That was n't bad , '' 
`` but there 's definite room for improvement . '' 
`` Let 's try again ... '' 
`` That was quite good , '' 
`` Well , no , it was lousy , but I know you can do it properly , I was watching from over there ... '' 
`` What about your parents ? '' 
`` He 's always saying he 'd believe anything of Fudge , I mean , the number of goblins Fudge has had assassinated ! And of course he uses the Department of Mysteries to develop terrible poisons , which he feeds secretly to anybody who disagrees with him . And then there 's his Umgubular Slashkilter -- '' 
`` Do n't ask , '' 
`` Well , that was pretty good , '' 
`` but we 've overrun , we 'd better leave it here . Same time , same place next week ? '' 
`` Let 's say next Wednesday night , then , '' 
`` and we can decide on additional meetings then ... Come on , we 'd better get going ... '' 
`` I got you loads more than you got me -- '' 
`` I did not only get you once , I got you at least three times -- '' 
`` Well , if you 're counting the one where you tripped over your own feet and knocked the wand out of my hand -- '' 
`` That is where I got the idea ... but you 'll notice I decided to engrave the date on bits of metal rather than on our members ' skin ... '' 
`` Yeah ... I prefer your way , '' 
`` Hey , Potty , I heard Warrington 's sworn to knock you off your broom on Saturday , '' 
`` Warrington 's aim 's so pathetic I 'd be more worried if he was aiming for the person next to me , '' 
`` You all right ? '' 
`` You just need some breakfast , '' 
`` Do n't be thick , '' 
`` Get a grip , '' 
`` That was an accident , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` a few more accidents like that and the game 's in the bag , is n't it ? '' 
`` He 's just nervous , '' 
`` Hello , '' 
`` We 'll be there in a bit , '' 
`` Last year 's Beaters , Derrick and Bole , have left now , but it looks as though Montague 's replaced them with the usual gorillas , rather than anyone who can fly particularly well . They 're two blokes called Crabbe and Goyle , I do n't know much about them -- '' 
`` We do , '' 
`` Crabbe and Goyle are in the same mold , '' 
`` -- dodges Warrington , avoids a Bludger -- close call , Alicia -- and the crowd are loving this , just listen to them , what 's that they 're singing ? '' 
`` GET GOING ! '' 
`` -- and Katie Bell of Gryffindor dodges Pucey , ducks Montague , nice swerve , Katie , and she throws to Johnson , Angelina Johnson takes the Quaffle , she 's past Warrington , she 's heading for goal , come on now Angelina -- GRYFFINDOR SCORE ! It 's forty-ten , fortyten to Slytherin and Pucey has the Quaffle ... '' 
`` ' Course I am , '' 
`` He whacked the Bludger at you the moment he saw you 'd got the Snitch -- but we won , Harry , we won ! '' 
`` I 've never seen a worse Keeper ... but then he was born in a bin ... Did you like my lyrics , Potter ? '' 
`` Spend holidays there and everything , do n't you ? Ca n't see how you stand the stink , but I suppose when you 've been dragged up by Muggles even the Weasleys ' hovel smells okay -- '' 
`` I 've never seen behavior like it -- back up to the castle , both of you , and straight to your Head of House 's office ! Go ! Now ! '' 
`` Malfoy provoked us , '' 
`` Why , I thought you might be grateful for a little extra authority . '' 
`` Ban us ? '' 
`` I would 've pounded the little scumbag to a pulp if you three had n't been holding me back . '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` If you resign , '' 
`` there 'll only be three players left on the team . '' 
`` Look , drop it , will you ! '' 
`` Join the club , '' 
`` Oh yeah ? '' 
`` Hagrid , it 's us ! '' 
`` So are you going to tell us what 's happened to you ? '' 
`` So you have been to look for giants ? '' 
`` Yeah , all righ ' , '' 
`` I have . '' 
`` The Ministry 's keepin ' an eye on Dumbledore an ' anyone they reckon 's in league with him , an ' -- '' 
`` We know about that , '' 
`` Go on ! '' 
`` And how many were there ? '' 
`` So , '' 
`` you saw them and then what ? '' 
`` Oh , I ... had a bit of an accident , '' 
`` I -- I 've been away for me health , '' 
`` She 's goin ' back ter the castle , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Lis ' en , it 's bin a long day an ' it 's late , '' 
`` Oh -- sorry -- '' 
`` He was n't even there when I arrived , I was knocking for at least half an hour . And then he came stumping out of the forest -- '' 
`` What 's he keeping in there ? Did he say ? '' 
`` Bit more sheltered ! Anyway , they prefer the dark ... '' 
`` What prefers the dark ? '' 
`` What did he say prefers the dark -- did you hear ? '' 
`` Now , they 'll be attracted by the smell o ' the meat but I 'm goin ' ter give ’em a call anyway , ’cause they 'll like ter know it 's me ... '' 
`` Yeah ... yeah , I knew you 'd be able ter , Harry , '' 
`` Er -- thestrals ! '' 
`` Big -- er -- winged horses , yeh know ! '' 
`` I think I 've got enough to be getting along with ... You will receive '' 
`` Do you ? '' 
`` Oh Harry -- I 'm sorry -- no , of course I do n't -- that was a really stupid thing to say -- '' 
`` It 's okay , '' 
`` do n't worry ... '' 
`` I 'm surprised so many people could see them , '' 
`` All those poor elves I have n't set free yet , having to stay over during Christmas because there are n't enough hats ! '' 
`` Why do I have to study Occlu -- thing ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Sirius ! '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` Sirius , do n't -- '' 
`` Are you calling me a coward ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` Right -- yeah , '' 
`` And listen ... '' 
`` Yeah , all right , '' 
`` I 'll let you know when the next one is , '' 
`` but I ca n't do it tonight , I 've got to go to -- er -- Remedial Potions ... '' 
`` You take Remedial Potions ? '' 
`` Forget it , '' 
`` It 's what everyone 's going to think , is n't it ? That I 'm really stup -- '' 
`` Hi , Harry , '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Yeah , not bad , '' 
`` What ? Oh no , I have n't checked the notice board since I got back ... '' 
`` Yes , it 's on Valentine 's Day ... '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` I suppose you want to know when the next D.A. meeting is ? '' 
`` I -- er -- '' 
`` Cho ! Hey -- CHO ! '' 
`` Right ... well ... that 's settled then , '' 
`` Shut the door behind you , Potter . '' 
`` Well , Potter , you know why you are here , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Yes ... sir , '' 
`` And why does Professor Dumbledore think I need it , sir ? '' 
`` He can read minds ? '' 
`` Only Muggles talk of ` mind reading . ' The mind is not a book , to be opened at will and examined at leisure . Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls , to be perused by any invader . The mind is a complex and many-layered thing , Potter ... or at least , most minds are ... '' 
`` The usual rules do not seem to apply with you , Potter . The curse that failed to kill you seems to have forged some kind of connection between you and the Dark Lord . The evidence suggests that at times , when your mind is most relaxed and vulnerable -- when you are asleep , for instance -- you are sharing the Dark Lord 's thoughts and emotions . The headmaster thinks it inadvisable for this to continue . He wishes me to teach you how to close your mind to the Dark Lord . '' 
`` But why does Professor Dumbledore want to stop it ? '' 
`` I thought I just told you not to interrupt me , Potter ? '' 
`` Professor Dumbledore says his name , '' 
`` I just wanted to know , '' 
`` why -- '' 
`` You seem to have visited the snake 's mind because that was where the Dark Lord was at that particular moment , '' 
`` How do you know ? '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' 
`` but how do you know -- ? '' 
`` And he might try and make me do things ? '' 
`` And what are you going to do ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Did you see everything I saw ? '' 
`` My Aunt Marge , '' 
`` I 'm trying , '' 
`` but you 're not telling me how ! '' 
`` Now , I want you to close your eyes . '' 
`` Let go of all emotion ... '' 
`` Let 's go again ... on the count of three ... one -- two -- three -- Legilimens ! '' 
`` Get up ! You are not trying , you are making no effort , you are allowing me access to memories you fear , handing me weapons ! '' 
`` I -- am -- making -- an -- effort , '' 
`` Yeah ? Well , I 'm finding that hard at the moment , '' 
`` I am not weak , '' 
`` I saw -- I remembered , '' 
`` I said , what 's in the Department of Mysteries , sir ? '' 
`` Because , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` And be warned , Potter ... I shall know if you have not practiced ... '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Yeah ... fine ... I dunno , '' 
`` Listen ... I 've just realized something ... '' 
`` In the Department of Mysteries , it 's got to be , '' 
`` That is a bit odd ... '' 
`` So what 's in the Department of Mysteries ? '' 
`` It will be something top secret that the Ministry has been developing , I expect ... Harry , are you sure you 're all right ? '' 
`` Yeah ... fine ... '' 
`` I mean , obviously it 's some kind of Invisibility Spell , but it 's rather clever to have extended the field of invisibility beyond the boundaries of the charmed object ... I 'd imagine the charm would n't have a very long life though ... '' 
`` I 'm going to have to do this tomorrow , '' 
`` So you do n't forget ! '' 
`` Do n't leave it till later , you big second-rater ! '' 
`` I think I 'll go to bed , '' 
`` I ... dunno ... '' 
`` Something good 's happened , '' 
`` She says your defenses will be low at the moment , after Snape 's been fiddling around with your mind ... Still , I suppose it 'll help in the long run , wo n't it ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Black ? '' 
`` That 's why he was happy last night ... '' 
`` I do n't believe this , '' 
`` Fudge is blaming the breakout on Sirius ? '' 
`` What now ? '' 
`` Are you okay , Hagrid ? '' 
`` If they do , we 're not going to hear about it , are we ? '' 
`` Exploding Snap 's got nothing to do with Defense Against the Dark Arts , Professor ! That 's not information relating to your subject ! '' 
`` If she catches yeh , it 'll be all of our necks on the line , '' 
`` It 's lessons with Snape that are making it worse , '' 
`` I 'm getting sick of my scar hurting , and I 'm getting bored walking down that corridor every night . '' 
`` I am working ! '' 
`` Well , maybe Snape is n't really trying to help Harry ... '' 
`` Maybe , '' 
`` he 's actually trying to open Harry 's mind a bit wider ... make it easier for You-Know -- '' 
`` Shut up , Ron , '' 
`` Well ... I dunno , '' 
`` Are you coming ? '' 
`` I ca n't come into Hogsmeade at all , Angelina wants a full day 's training . Like it 's going to help -- we 're the worst team I 've ever seen . You should see Sloper and Kirke , they 're pathetic , even worse than I am . '' 
`` I dunno why Angelina wo n't just let me resign ... '' 
`` It 's because you 're good when you 're on form , that 's why , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Well -- er -- shall we go , then ? '' 
`` You really miss it , do n't you ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Urgh , Chang , I do n't think much of your taste ... At least Diggory was good-looking ! '' 
`` So ... where d’you want to go ? '' 
`` Remember when that Sirius Black escaped , and there were dementors all over Hogsmeade looking for him ? And now ten Death Eaters are on the loose and there are n't dementors anywhere ... '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yeah , it is weird ... '' 
`` Yeah , all right , '' 
`` Er ... yeah , '' 
`` A couple of weeks ago . Roger . I turned him down , though . '' 
`` I 've been meaning to ask you for ages ... Did Cedric -- did he m-m-mention me at all before he died ? '' 
`` Well -- I have talked about it , '' 
`` to Ron and Hermione , but -- '' 
`` Oh , you 'll talk to Hermione Granger ! '' 
`` But you wo n't talk to me ! P-perhaps it would be best if we just ... just p-paid and you went and met up with Hermione G-Granger , like you obviously want to ! '' 
`` Cho ? '' 
`` It 's not like that ! '' 
`` Cho ! '' 
`` Yeah , I 'm fine , '' 
`` Oh yeah , I 'm grand , Harry , grand ... '' 
`` Er -- '' 
`` An ' both orphans . Yeah ... both orphans . '' 
`` Makes a diff 're nce , havin ' a decent family , '' 
`` Yeah ... I s ' pose , '' 
`` Whatever yeh say , blood 's important ... '' 
`` Hagrid , '' 
`` where are you getting all these injuries ? '' 
`` All those ! '' 
`` I got a rough job . '' 
`` I 'll be seein ' yeh , Harry ... Take care now ... '' 
`` What are you up to ? '' 
`` I was n't the sole witness , '' 
`` I suppose , '' 
`` Ca n't wait to see what Umbridge thinks of you going public , '' 
`` It must have been ... tough ... talking about it ... Was it ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` but people have got to know what Voldemort 's capable of , have n't they ? '' 
`` Er ... well , it was ... '' 
`` a complete fiasco , now you mention it . '' 
`` ... so then , '' 
`` she jumps up , right , and says ` I 'll see you around , Harry , ' and runs out of the place ! '' 
`` Me , tactless ? '' 
`` But , but , '' 
`` but -- you told me to meet you at twelve and to bring her along , how was I supposed to do that without telling her -- ? '' 
`` But I do n't think you 're ugly , '' 
`` Is that what she was doing ? '' 
`` Well , they should ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Good . We were watching their practice . They 're going to be slaughtered . They 're complete rubbish without us . '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` you 're good on feelings and stuff , but you just do n't understand about Quidditch . '' 
`` Good catch , '' 
`` She says she knows he 's got it in him . '' 
`` Who 're you after ? '' 
`` I think I know what this means -- open this one first ! '' 
`` It came out yesterday , I asked Dad to send you a free copy . I expect all these , '' 
`` are letters from readers . '' 
`` Help yourself , '' 
`` This one looks okay , though , '' 
`` Well , Harry Potter ? '' 
`` People have written to me because I gave an interview , '' 
`` About what happened to me last June . '' 
`` I mean a reporter asked me questions and I answered them , '' 
`` Here -- '' 
`` Last Hogsmeade weekend , '' 
`` What exactly are you so happy about ? '' 
`` and Harry , I think they believe you , I really do , I think you 've finally got them convinced ! '' 
`` Shh ! '' 
`` I believe you . And I 've sent a copy of that magazine to me mam . '' 
`` He ca n't believe it , he says people seem even more interested in this than the Crumple-Horned Snorkacks ! '' 
`` The Ministry are morons '' 
`` Eat dung , Umbridge '' 
`` I have been badly advised , it seems , '' 
`` I do not blame you , Rookwood , '' 
`` You are sure of your facts , Rookwood ? '' 
`` Bode could never have taken it , Master ... Bode would have known he could not ... Undoubtedly that is why he fought so hard against Malfoy 's Imperius Curse ... '' 
`` Stand up , Rookwood , '' 
`` You have done well to tell me this , '' 
`` No -- everyone 's fine -- '' 
`` Well ... Avery is n't ... He 's in trouble ... He gave him the wrong information ... He 's really angry ... '' 
`` I was Voldemort , '' 
`` But -- Harry , that 's got to be -- '' 
`` The weapon , '' 
`` that you were Voldemort ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` they '' 
`` He was even hanging around that day I had my hearing , '' 
`` In the -- hang on ... '' 
`` I did n't hear all the conversation , but that 's what it sounded like , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I know I am , '' 
`` And you ought to put in a bit more effort on your Occlumency from now on . '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` I mean the one concerning a man kneeling in the middle of a darkened room ... '' 
`` It 's ... nothing , '' 
`` It -- '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` So I can learn Occlumency , '' 
`` Correct , Potter . And dim though you may be '' 
`` I would have thought that after two months ' worth of lessons you might have made some progress . How many other dreams about the Dark Lord have you had ? '' 
`` Just that one , '' 
`` No , they do n't , '' 
`` No -- that 's your job , is n't it ? '' 
`` One -- two -- three -- Legilimens ! '' 
`` I do n't remember telling you to use a Shield Charm ... but there is no doubt that it was effective ... '' 
`` On the count of three , then , '' 
`` One -- two -- '' 
`` POTTER ! '' 
`` Explain yourself ! '' 
`` I ... dunno what happened , '' 
`` Can you tell me something , sir ? '' 
`` Did you see anything unusual on your way down here , Potter ? '' 
`` You did n't realize this was coming ? '' 
`` Oh , very good , Minister , very good ! '' 
`` Excellent , Dolores . And ... by thunder ... '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` I 've told you , '' 
`` Pretty much , '' 
`` Harry , I think you should go back to him and ask -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Nothing ... '' 
`` Wha -- oh yeah , we have , '' 
`` That sneak friend of hers , Marietta , '' 
`` yeah '' 
`` that 's right '' 
`` Huh ? '' 
`` Oh hi , '' 
`` Yeah , I 'm fine , '' 
`` You know , I 'm sure if you just talked to Cho ... '' 
`` It 's not Cho I want to talk to , '' 
`` I ... '' 
`` I wish I could talk to Sirius , '' 
`` But I know I ca n't . '' 
`` WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING ? '' 
`` You 'd need more than a good sense of fun to liaise with my uncle , '' 
`` Good sense of when to duck , more like ... '' 
`` ' Course , '' 
`` ' course we 'll come ... '' 
`` You mean Umbridge ? '' 
`` It 'll be Ravenclaw , '' 
`` Tha 's good ... '' 
`` We 're goin ' in here , '' 
`` C’mon now , quick , before we 're spotted ! '' 
`` Hagrid , why are you armed ? '' 
`` They used ter be -- well , yeh couldn ' call ’em friendly -- but we got on all righ ' . Kept ’em selves to ’em selves , bu ' always turned up if I wanted a word . Not anymore ... '' 
`` Firenze said that they 're angry because he went to work for Dumbledore ? '' 
`` And you stopped it ? '' 
`` Lucky I was passin ' , really ... an ' I 'd 've thought Firenze mighta remembered tha ' before he started sendin ' me stupid warnin 's ! '' 
`` Anyway , '' 
`` since then the other centaurs 've bin livid with me an ' the trouble is , they 've got a lot of influence in the forest ... Cleverest creatures in here ... '' 
`` Is that why we 're here , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Hagrid ? '' 
`` In fact ... '' 
`` Well ... see ... the thing is ... '' 
`` Well , there 's a good chance I 'm goin ' ter be gettin ' the sack any day now , '' 
`` And was it ? '' 
`` On ' y anythin ' ter do with magical creatures an ' she thinks it 's got somethin’ ter do with me . Yeh know she 's bin lookin ' fer a chance ter get rid of me ever since I got back . I don ' wan ' ter go , o ' course , but if it wasn ' fer ... well ... the special circumstances I 'm abou ' ter explain to yeh , I 'd leave righ now , before she 's go ' the chance ter do it in front o ' the whole school , like she did with Trelawney . '' 
`` Don ' worry abou ' me , '' 
`` Of course we 'll help you , '' 
`` Really easy , '' 
`` Very quiet , now ... '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Hagrid , when you say ` brother , ' '' 
`` do you mean -- ? '' 
`` Grawp ? '' 
`` Did Madame Maxime want to bring him back ? '' 
`` How on earth did you get him back without anyone noticing ? '' 
`` I 'll admit he mighta taken a couple o ' swings at me when he 's bin in a bad mood , but he 's gettin ' better , loads better , settlin ' down well ... '' 
`` What are those ropes for , then ? '' 
`` See -- it 's like I say -- he doesn ' really know his strength -- '' 
`` After I 'm gone . '' 
`` He can get his own food , no problem . Birds an ' deer an ' stuff ... No , it 's company he needs . If I jus ' knew someone was carryin ' on tryin ' ter help him a bit ... teachin ' him , yeh know ... '' 
`` You want us to teach him , '' 
`` ’Cause I reckon , if he can talk ter people , he 'll understand more that we all like him really , an ' want him to stay ... '' 
`` Kind of makes you wish we had Norbert back , does n't it ? '' 
`` We 'll ... '' 
`` Had a nice sleep , eh ? '' 
`` Oh my ... '' 
`` Tha 's how you ended up pullin ' up the others -- '' 
`` Would yeh mind if he called yeh Hermy , Hermione ? On ' y it 's a difficult name fer him ter remember ... '' 
`` BAD BOY , GRAWPY ! '' 
`` VERY BAD BOY ! YEH DON ' GRAB -- OUCH ! '' 
`` Well ... there yeh are ... Yeh 've met him an ' -- an ' now he 'll know yeh when yeh come back . Yeah ... well ... '' 
`` Well , I reckon tha 's enough fer one day , '' 
`` We 'll -- er -- we 'll go back now , shall we ? '' 
`` So , '' 
`` Why do n't you just do it yourself ? '' 
`` Is that them ? Is that the examiners ? '' 
`` Well , it was n't too bad , was it ? '' 
`` The famous Potter ? '' 
`` That 's it , '' 
`` no need to be nervous ... Now , if I could ask you to take this eggcup and make it do some cartwheels for me ... '' 
`` Very good indeed ! Well , I think that 's all , Potter ... unless ... '' 
`` I heard , from my dear friend Tiberius Ogden , that you can produce a Patronus ? For a bonus point ... ? '' 
`` Very well , Potter , you may go ! '' 
`` Outstanding '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` He 's teaching at the moment , she ca n't blame him , '' 
`` We should n't have taken the stupid subject in the first place , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` No more pretending we care what happens when Jupiter and Uranus get too friendly ... '' 
`` And from now on , I do n't care if my tea leaves spell die , Ron , die -- I 'm just chucking them in the bin where they belong . '' 
`` That 's true , '' 
`` You may begin ... '' 
`` Take it for me ... Lift it down , now ... I can not touch it ... but you can ... '' 
`` Crucio ! '' 
`` It 's none of your business who I talk to , '' 
`` Well , it does n't surprise me . Potter has never shown much inclination to follow school rules . '' 
`` He 's got Padfoot ! '' 
`` It was you ? '' 
`` No way ! '' 
`` Can we have your wand , then , if we 're going first ? '' 
`` The Ministry places a rather higher value on my life than yours , I 'm afraid . '' 
`` Yes , it 's well hidden . '' 
`` Er -- are you sure this is the right way ? '' 
`` Hermione , keep your voice down , '' 
`` You 'll see ... '' 
`` How much further ? '' 
`` Nooooo ! '' 
`` Noooooo ... I am Senior Undersecretary ... you can not ... unhand me , you animals ... nooooo ! '' 
`` Now ! '' 
`` They are young , '' 
`` We 're not going to say anything like that ! '' 
`` Perhaps you thought us pretty talking horses ? We are an ancient people who will not stand wizard invasions and insults ! We do not recognize your laws , we do not acknowledge your superiority , we are -- '' 
`` Hagger . '' 
`` hagger '' 
`` Hagger ! '' 
`` Oh , that was horrible . And he might kill them all ... '' 
`` I 'm not that fussed , to be honest , '' 
`` Smart plan , '' 
`` By the time we 've done that , Sirius 'll probably be dead ! '' 
`` had any ideas ? '' 
`` How did you get away ? '' 
`` She got carried away , '' 
`` No , they got chased off by Grawp , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` and I 'm FIGHT AND FLIGHT ` 761 ` sure Sirius is still alive , but I ca n't see how we 're going to get there to help him . '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` You 're too -- '' 
`` No -- of course it was n't -- '' 
`` Well , it does n't matter anyway , '' 
`` because we still do n't know how to get there -- '' 
`` I thought we 'd settled that ? '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Do n't be stupid , we ca n't all go ! '' 
`` Look , you FIGHT AND FLIGHT ` 763 ` three '' 
`` Okay , then , '' 
`` Look , here come more now ... You two must really smell ... '' 
`` All right , '' 
`` pick one and get on , then . '' 
`` Mad ... if I could just see it -- '' 
`` You 'd better hope it stays invisible , '' 
`` We all ready , then ? '' 
`` Okay ... '' 
`` Ministry of Magic , visitors ' entrance , London , then , '' 
`` This is bizarre ! '' 
`` Over here , '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` Harry Potter , Ron Weasley , Hermione Granger , '' 
`` Ginny Weasley , Neville Longbottom , Luna Lovegood ... We 're here to save someone , unless your Ministry can do it first ! '' 
`` Visitor to the Ministry , you are required to submit to a search and present your wand for registration at the security desk , which is located at the far end of the Atrium . '' 
`` Fine ! '' 
`` Come on , '' 
`` Let 's go , '' 
`` Okay , listen , '' 
`` Someone shut the door , '' 
`` Well , that does n't matter now , '' 
`` I do n't -- '' 
`` In the dreams I went through the door at the end of the corridor from the lifts into a dark room -- that 's this one -- and then I went through another door into a room that kind of ... glitters . We should try a few doors , '' 
`` I 'll know the right way when I see it . C’mon . '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` Yes ... I wonder what they 're doing with them ? '' 
`` Let 's get out of here , '' 
`` In my dream I went through that dark room into the second one , '' 
`` Good thinking , '' 
`` Okay , let 's try this one -- '' 
`` Who 's there ? '' 
`` Sirius ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` What are you saying ? '' 
`` Someone 's whispering behind there , '' 
`` Ca n't anyone else hear it ? '' 
`` What d’you reckon that arch was ? '' 
`` It 's ... locked ... '' 
`` Sirius 's knife ! '' 
`` This is it ! '' 
`` This way ! '' 
`` Keep going ! '' 
`` This is it , '' 
`` It 's through here -- '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Yes ... that 's fifty-four ... '' 
`` Keep your wands out , '' 
`` He 's right down at the end , '' 
`` You ca n't see properly from here ... '' 
`` He should be near here , '' 
`` He might be ... '' 
`` Or maybe ... '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` My name ? '' 
`` It 's got my name on , '' 
`` Where 's Sirius ? '' 
`` The Dark Lord always knows ! '' 
`` You 've got him , '' 
`` Do n't do anything , '' 
`` I know Sirius is here , '' 
`` Go on , then , '' 
`` Yeah , right ! '' 
`` Accio Proph -- '' 
`` Protego ! '' 
`` If you smash it -- ! '' 
`` Let him watch while we torture the little girl . I 'll do it . '' 
`` You 'll have to smash this if you want to attack any of us , '' 
`` So , '' 
`` what kind of prophecy are we talking about anyway ? '' 
`` Nope , not jesting , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Did you know he 's a half-blood too ? '' 
`` You have n't told me what 's so special about this prophecy I 'm supposed to be handing over , '' 
`` I 'm not playing games , '' 
`` I -- what ? '' 
`` Did he ? '' 
`` About both of you , Potter , about both of you ... Have n't you ever wondered why the Dark Lord tried to kill you as a baby ? '' 
`` Someone made a prophecy about Voldemort and me ? '' 
`` So he 's got you doing his dirty work for him , has he ? '' 
`` NOW ! '' 
`` RUN ! '' 
`` Where -- where are the others ? '' 
`` Well , we do n't stand here waiting for them to find us , for a start , '' 
`` Alohomora ! '' 
`` Check under the desks , '' 
`` STUPEFY ! '' 
`` Avada -- '' 
`` STUP -- '' 
`` STUPEFY ! '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` right , let 's get out of -- '' 
`` Look out ! '' 
`` RON ? '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` IMPEDIMENTA ! '' 
`` WE 'VE GOT HIM ! '' 
`` IN AN OFFICE OFF -- '' 
`` Silencio ! '' 
`` Petrificus Totalus ! '' 
`` HERMIONE ! '' 
`` PETRIFICUS TOTALUS ! '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` Dat 's a pulse , Harry , I ' b sure id is ... '' 
`` Yeah , I dink so ... '' 
`` Neville , we 're not far from the exit , '' 
`` I 've got to find the others , '' 
`` Wait , '' 
`` He 's never going to notice us , '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
'' C H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S I X ` 807 ` THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED e has n't gone ! '' 
`` HE -- IS -- NOT -- DEAD ! '' 
`` Was dat man -- was Sirius Black a -- a friend of yours ? '' 
`` Finite . '' 
`` SHE KILLED SIRIUS ! '' 
`` SHE KILLED HIM -- I 'LL KILL HER ! '' 
`` Wingardium Leviosa ! '' 
`` I am ! '' 
`` Aaaaaah ... did you love him , little baby Potter ? '' 
`` Crucio ! '' 
`` You need to mean them , Potter ! You need to really want to cause pain -- to enjoy it -- righteous anger wo n't hurt me for long -- I 'll show you how it is done , shall I ? I 'll give you a lesson -- '' 
`` Stupefy ! '' 
`` Well , you 're going to have to kill me , because it 's gone ! '' 
`` And he knows ! '' 
`` YOU 'VE GOT IT , POTTER , AND YOU WILL GIVE IT TO ME -- Accio Prophecy ! ACCIO PROPHECY ! '' 
`` Nothing there ! '' 
`` Do n't waste your breath ! '' 
`` You have irked me too often , for too long . AVADA KEDAVRA ! '' 
`` Look out ! '' 
`` Kill me now , Dumbledore ... '' 
`` If death is nothing , Dumbledore , kill the boy ... '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` You -- here -- I -- I -- '' 
`` Seize him ! '' 
`` One ... two ... three ... '' 
`` Another message for my worthless great-great-grandson ? '' 
`` Dumbledore thinks very highly of you , as I am sure you know , '' 
`` Oh yes . Holds you in great esteem . '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` Nymphadora Tonks may need to spend a little time in St. Mungo 's , but it seems that she will make a full recovery . '' 
`` No , you do n't , '' 
`` There is no shame in what you are feeling , Harry , '' 
`` On the contrary ... the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength . '' 
`` My greatest strength , is it ? '' 
`` Harry , suffering like this proves you are still a man ! This pain is part of being human -- '' 
`` THEN -- I -- DO N'T -- WANT -- TO -- BE -- HUMAN ! '' 
`` I DO N'T CARE ! '' 
`` I 'VE HAD ENOUGH , I 'VE SEEN ENOUGH , I WANT OUT , I WANT IT TO END , I DO N'T CARE ANYMORE -- '' 
`` I -- DO N'T ! '' 
`` YOU DO N'T KNOW HOW I FEEL ! '' 
`` YOU -- STANDING THERE -- YOU -- '' 
`` Let me out , '' 
`` Let me out , '' 
`` Let me out , '' 
`` Do you -- do you think I want to -- do you think I give a -- I DO N'T CARE WHAT YOU 'VE GOT TO SAY ! '' 
`` Or I should say almost entirely my fault -- I will not be so arrogant as to claim responsibility for the whole . Sirius was a brave , clever , and energetic man , and such men are not usually content to sit at home in hiding while they believe others to be in danger . Nevertheless , you should never have believed for an instant that there was any necessity for you to go to the Department of Mysteries tonight . If I had been open with you , Harry , as I should have been , you would have known a long time CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN ` 826 ` ago that Voldemort might try and lure you to the Department of Mysteries , and you would never have been tricked into going there tonight . And Sirius would not have had to come after you . That blame lies with me , and with me alone . '' 
`` that my great-great-grandson -- the last of the Blacks -- is dead ? '' 
`` You 've told me this before , Professor , '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` And this ability of yours -- to detect Voldemort 's presence , even when he is disguised , and to know what he is feeling when his emotions are roused -- has become more and more pronounced since Voldemort returned to his own body and his full powers . '' 
`` Yeah , Snape told me , '' 
`` But did you not wonder why it was not I who explained this to you ? Why I did not teach you Occlumency ? Why I had not so much as looked at you for months ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` She does n't love me , '' 
`` Wait , '' 
`` Wait a moment . '' 
`` It did , '' 
`` Well -- my uncle more than her . He wanted to chuck me out , but after the Howler came she -- she said I THE LOST PROPHECY ` 837 ` had to stay . '' 
`` But what 's this got to do with ... '' 
`` I do n't understand what you 're saying , '' 
`` Do n't you remember asking me , as you lay in the hospital wing , why Voldemort had tried to kill you when you were a baby ? '' 
`` Ought I to have told you then ? '' 
`` He 's got to , '' 
`` the other centaurs wo n't take him back , will they ? '' 
`` After we 've just found out that there are real prophecies ? '' 
`` Er -- Hagrid 's , '' 
`` And ask him what 's happening about ... about his little friend ! '' 
`` You 're dead , Potter . '' 
`` Funny , '' 
`` you 'd think I 'd have stopped walking around ... '' 
`` I 'm going to make you pay for what you 've done to my father ... '' 
`` Well , I 'm terrified now , '' 
`` I s ' pose Lord Voldemort 's just a warm-up act compared to you three -- what 's the matter ? '' 
`` You wait . I 'll have you . You ca n't land my father in prison -- '' 
`` I thought I just had , '' 
`` Dad and the others 'll be out in no time ... '' 
`` Yeah , I expect they will , '' 
`` I 'm trying to decide what curse to use on Malfoy , sir , '' 
`` Put that wand away at once , '' 
`` All right , '' 
`` Like I wanted to come , '' 
`` Third years at Hog -- at my school are allowed to visit the village sometimes , '' 
`` I need you to sign the permission form , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` it 'll be hard work , pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits -- '' 
`` St. Brutus 's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys ! '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Knocking the stuffing out of me wo n't make Aunt Marge forget what I could tell her , '' 
`` But if you sign my permission form , '' 
`` I swear I 'll remember where I 'm supposed to go to school , and I 'll act like a Mug -- like I 'm normal and everything . '' 
`` Hedwig , '' 
`` you 're going to have to clear off for a week . Go with Errol . Ron 'll look after you . I 'll write him a note , explaining . And do n't look at me like that '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` It 's damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you . Would n't have done it myself . You 'd have gone straight to an orphanage if you 'd been dumped on my doorstep . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` all the time . '' 
`` Oh , yeah , '' 
`` loads of times . '' 
`` If there 's something rotten on the inside , there 's nothing anyone can do about it . '' 
`` This one 's got a mean , runty look about him . You get that with dogs . I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year . Ratty little thing it wasWeak . Underbred . '' 
`` COME BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT ! '' 
`` She deserved it , '' 
`` She deserved what she got . You keep away from me . '' 
`` I 'm going , '' 
`` I 've had enough . '' 
`` Lumos , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` How come the Muggles do n't hear the bus ? '' 
`` That man ! '' 
`` Sirius Black , '' 
'' ` Course ' e was on the Muggle news , Neville , where you been ? '' 
`` You oughta read the papers more , Neville . '' 
`` He murdered thirteen people ? '' 
`` What , Voldemort ? '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` Blimey , my ` eart 's goin ' that fast ... '' 
`` So -- so Black was a supporter of Voldemort ? '' 
`` Yeah , that 's right . Very close to You-Know - ` Oo , they say . Anyway , when little ` Arry Potter got the better of You-Know - ` Oo -- '' 
`` Diagon Alley , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Well , '' 
'' ` Bye then ! '' 
`` I broke the law ! '' 
`` It was an accident ! We do n't send people to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts ! '' 
`` Last year , I got an official warning just because a house-elf smashed a pudding in my uncle 's house ! '' 
`` The Ministry of Magic said I 'd be expelled from Hogwarts if there was any more magic there ! '' 
`` Of course I do n't , '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` but why ? '' 
`` Arrived about five minutes after you did . If there 's anything you need , Harry Potter , do n't hesitate to ask . '' 
`` It 's been a very weird night , Hedwig , '' 
`` Hogwarts ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I need -- '' 
`` Get out of the way , '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` I 've already got one of those . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I need Unfogging the 44 Future by Cassandra Vablatsky . '' 
`` You 'll start seeing death omens everywhere . It 's enough to frighten anyone to death . '' 
`` Anything else ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Er -- I need Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells , Grade Three . '' 
`` It ca n't have been a death omen , '' 
`` I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia Crescent ... It was probably just a stray dog ... '' 
`` You 're fighting a losing battle there , dear , '' 
`` We went to the Leaky Cauldron , but they said you 'd left , and we went to Flourish and Blotts , and Madam Malkin 's , and -- '' 
`` I got all my school stuff last week , '' 
`` I did n't mean to , '' 
`` So am I , '' 
`` Forget expelled , I thought I was going to be arrested . '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
`` What 's all that , Hermione ? '' 
`` Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year , Hermione ? '' 
`` Fine , thanks , '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
`` I 'll get Scabbers 's stuff , I 'm packed , '' 
'' -- makes no sense not to tell him , '' 
`` It 's late , Molly , we 'd better go up ... '' 
`` I 'm not going to be murdered , '' 
`` I 've got something to tell you , '' 
`` Later , '' 
`` New teacher , '' 
`` Hullo , Neville , '' 
`` Not here ! '' 
`` Harry ! Harry ! Are you all right ? '' 
`` W -- what ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Eat it . It 'll help . '' 
`` What was that thing ? '' 
`` But did n't any of you -- fall off your seats ? '' 
`` Ginny was shaking like mad , though ... '' 
`` Are you all right , Harry ? '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Potter ! Granger ! I want to see you both ! '' 
`` I 'm fine , '' 
`` Are you all right ? '' 
`` Listen , '' 
`` Come follow me , dear friends , and we shall find our goal , or else shall perish bravely in the charge ! '' 
`` On foot then , good sirs and gentle lady ! On ! On ! '' 
'' ` Sibyll Trelawney , Divination teacher , '' 
`` How 're we supposed to get up there ? '' 
`` How nice to see you in the physical world at last . '' 
`` A load of soggy brown stuff , '' 
`` Right , you 've got a crooked sort of cross ... '' 
`` I 'll do it , '' 
`` Right then -- let 's see how yeh get on with Buckbeak . '' 
`` Yeh 've got eye contact , now try not ter blink ... Hippogriffs don ' trust yeh if yeh blink too much ... '' 
`` Tha 's it , Harry ... now , bow . '' 
`` I 'm allowed to walk across the grounds , '' 
'' ` Spect it 's a record , '' 
`` WHAT D'YEH THINK YOU 'RE DOIN ' , EH ? '' 
`` So that 's why you 're putting it on , '' 
`` have you heard ? Daily Prophet this morning -- they reckon 102 Sirius Black 's been sighted . '' 
`` Where ? '' 
`` Yeah , that 's right , '' 
`` Of course , if it was me , '' 
`` I 'd have done something before now . I would n't be staying in school like a good boy , I 'd be out there looking for him . '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` What did Malfoy mean ? '' 
`` I told you not to help him , Miss Granger . Class dismissed . '' 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` There she is , '' 
`` Why -- ? '' 
`` I 've been feeling a bit off-color , '' 
`` Yeah , maybe , '' 
`` Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor . Apparently she refused to let Black in without the password , so he attacked . She 's still very distressed , but once she 's calmed down , I 'll have Mr. Filch restore her . '' 
`` Many , Severus , each of them as unlikely as the next . '' 
`` You will each write an essay , to be handed in to me , on the ways you recognize and kill werewolves . I want two rolls of parchment or , the subject , and I want them by Monday morning . It is time somebody took this class in hand . Weasley , stay behind , we need to arrange your detention . '' 
`` Snape 's never been like this with any of our other Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers , even if he did want the job , '' 
`` Why could n't Black have hidden in Snape 's office , eh ? He could have finished him off for us ! '' 
`` What did you do that for ? '' 
`` You know , I reckon Ron was right about you , '' 
`` There are plenty of mice around this place -- go and chase them . Go on , '' 
`` Oh , shut up , '' 
`` Stand aside , you silly girl ... stand aside , now ... '' 
`` Not Harry , please no , take me , kill me instead -- '' 
`` Wait a moment , Harry , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Did you hear about the dementors too ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
'' Why ? Why do they affect me like that ? Am I just -- ? '' 
`` When they get near me -- '' 
`` Why did they have to come to the match ? '' 
`` Azkaban must be terrible , '' 
`` But Sirius Black escaped from them , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Black must have found a way to fight them . I would n't have believed it possible ... Dementors are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long ... '' 
`` You made that dementor on the train back off , '' 
`` What defenses ? '' 
`` Well ... all right . I 'll try and help . But it 'll have to wait until next 157 term , I 'm afraid . I have a lot to do before the holidays . I chose a very inconvenient time to fall ill . '' 
`` Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints from Honeydukes ! '' 
`` What are you doing ? '' 
`` And what do I need with a bit of old parchment ? '' 
`` Well ... when we were in our first year , Harry -- young , carefree , and innocent -- '' 
`` Do n't tell me -- '' 
`` You 're winding me up , '' 
`` Dissendium ! '' 
`` Lumos ! '' 
`` Mischief managed ! '' 
`` Definitely not , '' 
`` No , I 'm not ! '' 
`` He ca n't be getting in through a passage , '' 
`` There are seven secret tunnels on the map , right ? Fred and George reckon Filch already knows about four of them . And of the other three -- one of them 's caved in , so no one can get through it . one of them 's got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance , so you ca n't get out of it . And the one I just came through - well - - it 's really hard to see the entrance to it down in the cellar , so unless he knew it was there ... '' 
`` Are you going to report me ? '' 
`` Never saw one without the other , did you ? The number of times I had them in here -- ooh , they used to make me laugh . Quite the double act , Sirius Black and James Potter ! '' 
`` Harry , you -- you look terrible . '' 
`` Where is everyone ? '' 
`` It 's nearly lunchtime ; I was going to come and wake you up in a minute . '' 
`` I 'm fine , '' 
'' Again , Harry did n't answer . He did n't know what he wanted to do . All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing , while Black was at liberty , was almost more than he could stand . Malfoy knows , '' 
`` No , let 's visit Hagrid , '' 
`` Listen -- is that Fang ? '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` What about Dumbledore , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Listen , Hagrid , '' 
`` you ca n't give up . Hermione 's right , You just need a good defense . You can call us as witnesses -- '' 
`` He sent you the Invisibility Cloak anonymously ... '' 
`` That was my dad 's , though , '' 
`` I ca n't believe this , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Lupin ? Listen , if he had this much gold , he 'd be able to buy himself some new robes . '' 
`` What d'you mean , he was away ? '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` Because I thought -- and Professor Minerva McGonagall agrees with me -- that that broom was probably sent to Harry by Sirius Black ! '' 
`` Had a good Christmas ? '' 
`` I 've been , doing some thinking over Christmas , Harry . After last match , you know . If the dementors come to the next one ... I mean ... we ca n't afford you to -- well -- '' 
`` I 'm working on it , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Do n't get excited , Oliver , '' 
`` I have n't got it anymore . It was confiscated . '' 
`` Sirius Black '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` but Minerva McGonagall still wants to strip it down -- '' 
`` I 'll go and talk to her , Harry , '' 
`` She 's just trying to get us to talk to her again . '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` How does it work ? '' 
`` What does a Patronus look like ? '' 
`` With an incantation , which will work only if you are concentrating , with all your might , on a single , very happy memory . '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Expecto patronum , '' 
`` expecto patronum . '' 
`` Oh -- yeah -- '' 
`` Did you see that ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Expecto patronum ! '' 
`` Expecto patronum ! Expecto -- '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` Yes ... '' 
`` It 's getting worse , '' 
'' He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time , and the dementor rose out of it ; the room fell cold and dark ` EXPECTO PATRONUM ! '' 
`` EXPECTO PATRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM ! '' 
`` Riddikulus ! '' 
`` You 've had enough for one night . Here -- '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` Or I thought I did . You 'd better be off , Harry , it 's getting late . '' 
`` They 're dead and listening to echoes of them wo n't bring them back . You 'd better get a grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup . '' 
`` I heard her talking to Professor Vector , that Arithmancy witch , this morning . They were going on about yesterday 's lesson , but Hermione ca n't 've been there , because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures ! And Ernie McMillan told me she 's never missed a Muggle Studies class , but half of them are at the same time as Divination , and she 's never missed one of them either ! '' 
`` I 'm not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good , '' 
`` We 've checked for most of the usual curses , but Professor Flitwick believes the broom might be carrying a Hurling Hex . I shall tell you 204 once we 've finished checking it . Now , please stop badgering me . '' 
`` It 's what dementors do to those they wish to destroy utterly . I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there , because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim and -- and suck out his soul . '' 
`` He deserves it , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` For ... for some things ... '' 
`` I 've just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room , Well , here it is , we 've done everything we could think of , and there does n't seem to be anything wrong with it at all . You 've got a very good friend somewhere , Potter ... '' 
`` I can have it back ? '' 
`` I daresay you 'll need to get the feel of it before Saturday 's match , wo n't you ? And Potter -- do try and win , wo n't you ? Or we 'll be out of the running for the eighth year . in a row , as Professor Snape was kind enough to remind me only last night ... '' 
`` Yeah ... anything , '' 
`` Oddsbodikins , '' 
`` Can I just hold it , Harry ? '' 
`` I got it back , '' 
`` Yeah , I suppose so , '' 
`` I 've got to give Scabbers his rat tonic . '' 
`` Can I sit down , then ? '' 
`` How are you getting through all this stuff ? '' 
`` Why do n't you just drop a couple of subjects ? '' 
`` Arithmancy looks terrible , '' 
`` It 's my favorite subject ! It 's -- '' 
`` Yeah , that 's true , '' 
`` Okay , everyone , let 's go -- '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Anyway -- good work , everyone . Let 's get back to the tower ... turn in early -- '' 
`` I 'm staying out for a bit ; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt , '' 
`` Here you go , '' 
`` She 's still letting him wander about wherever he wants -- probably washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now ... '' 
`` Yeah , reckon so , '' 
`` Pity you ca n't attach an extra arm to yours , Malfoy , '' 
`` Mount your brooms ... on my whistle ... three -- two -- one -- '' 
`` Okay , okay , Gryffindor in possession , Katie Bell of Gryffindor , heading for goal ... '' 
`` KNOCK HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO ! '' 
`` Expecto patronum ! '' 
`` That was quite some Patronus , '' 
`` The dementors did n't affect me at all ! '' 
`` Come and see -- '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Did you even come to the match ? '' 
`` Come on , Hermione , come and have some food , '' 
`` Ca n't you give her a break ? '' 
`` AAARRGGHH ! NOOO ! '' 
`` D'you reckon we should tell someone ? '' 
`` We 'd 've heard if the shop had been broken into . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` She 's cried a fair few times , yeh know . Goin ' through a rough time at the moment . Bitten off more 'n she can chew , if yeh ask me , all the work she 's tryin ' ter do . Still found time ter help me with Buckbeak 's case , mind ... She 's found some really good stuff fer me ... reckon he 'll stand a good chance now ... '' 
`` Hagrid , we should 've helped as well -- sorry -- '' 
`` Gawd knows yeh 've had enough ter be gettin ' on with . I 've seen yeh practicin ' Quidditch ev'ry hour o ' the day an ' night -- but I got ta tell yeh , I thought you two 'd value yer friend more 'n broomsticks or rats . Tha 's all . '' 
`` Well , Filch has n't done anything about the passage into Honeydukes ... '' 
`` But I 'm taking the Invisibility Cloak this time . '' 
`` Dissendium ! '' 
`` Hi , Neville , '' 
`` I asked Nearly Headless Nick ... he says he 's heard a very rough crowd lives here . No one can get in . Fred and George tried , obviously , but all the entrances are sealed shut ... '' 
`` Suppose You 'd love to live here , would n't you , Weasley ? Dreaming about having your own bedroom ? I heard your family all sleep in one room -- is that true ? '' 
`` My dad did n't strut , '' 
`` Rules were for lesser mortals , not Quidditch Cup-winners . His head was so swollen -- '' 
`` SHUT UP ! '' 
`` I told you to shut up about my dad ! '' 
'' Harry bit his lip . He did n't know what had happened and did n't want to admit it -- but Snape seemed to have guessed the truth . I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your father , Potter , '' 
`` Turn out your pockets , or we go straight to the headmaster ! Pull them out , Potter ! '' 
`` Ron gave them to me , '' 
`` Spare bit of parchment , '' 
`` Surely you do n't need such a very old piece of parchment ? '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Is this another treasured gift from Mr. Weasley ? Or is it -- something else ? A letter , perhaps , written in invisible ink ? Or -- instructions to get into Hogsmeade without passing the dementors ? '' 
`` Let me see , let me see ... '' 
`` Reveal your secret ! '' 
`` And he 's supposed to be our teacher ! '' 
`` Come along , quickly , wands out , we 're experimenting with Cheering Charms today , we 've already divided into pairs -- '' 
`` Where 's Hermione gone ? '' 
`` That 's weird , '' 
`` Divination , but it 's not for another twenty minutes , '' 
`` But how could you forget ? '' 
`` Do n't complain , this means we 've finished palmistry , '' 
`` this is stupid '' 
`` Seen anything yet ? '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` Only if we 're more than fifty points up , Harry , or we win the match but lose the Cup . You 've got that , Have n't you ? You must catch the Snitch only if we 're -- '' 
`` I KNOW , OLIVER ! '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
`` Three ... two ... one ... '' 
`` YES ! SHE 'S BEATEN THE KEEPER ! TWENTY-ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR ! '' 
`` Superb ! Very difficult to pass -- very difficult indeed -- YES ! I DO N'T BELIEVE IT ! HE 'S SAVED IT ! '' 
`` THIRTY-ZERO ! TAKE THAT , YOU DIRTY , CHEATING -- '' 
`` Jordan , if you ca n't commentate in an unbiased way -- '' 
`` I 'm telling it like it is , Professor ! '' 
`` Sorry , Professor , sorry ! WoiA happen again ! So , Gryffindor in the lead , thirty points to ten , and Gryffindor in possession -- '' 
`` You -- '' 
`` Seventy - twenty to Gryffindor ... '' 
`` SHE SCORES ! SHE SCORES ! Gryffindor leads by eighty Points to twenty ! '' 
`` Is there any point asking how you 're going to sit for two exams at once ? '' 
`` Full marks . '' 
`` Hello there , Harry ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Pity ... pity ... '' 
`` As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time , and argue , hi case properly , they ca n't possibly execute Buckbeak ... '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` How 'd it go ? '' 
`` Could n't see a thing , so I made some stuff up . Do n't think she was convinced , though ... '' 
`` Meet you in the common room , '' 
`` If you would kindly gaze into the Orb ... Take your time , now ... then tell me what you see within it ... '' 
`` Er -- '' 
`` a dark shape ... um ... '' 
`` What does it resemble ? '' 
`` Think , now ... '' 
`` A hippogriff , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Well , dear , I think we 'll leave it there ... A little disappointing ... but I 'm sure you did your best . '' 
`` IT WILL HAPPEN TONIGHT . '' 
`` S -- sorry ? '' 
`` If you have n't been helping him , '' 
`` The Marauder 's Map . I was in my office examining it -- '' 
`` You know how to work it ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I believed it myself -- until I saw the map tonight . Because the Marauder 's map never lies ... Peter 's alive . Ron 's holding him , Harry . '' 
`` Because ... because people would know if Peter Pettigrew had been an Animagus . We did Animagi in class with Professor Minerva McGonagall . And I looked them up when I did my homework -- the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can become animals ; there 's a register showing what animal they become , and their markings and things ... and I went and looked Professor Minerva McGonagall up on the register , and there have been only seven Animagi this century , and Pettigrew 's name was n't on the list . '' 
`` We were in the same year , you know , and we -- er -- did n't like each other very much . He especially disliked James . Jealous , I think , of James 's talent on the Quidditch field ... anyway Snape had seen me crossing the grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward the Whomping Willow to transform . Sirius thought it would be -- er -- amusing , to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick , and he 'd be able to get in after me . Well , of course , Snape tried it -- if he 'd got as far as this house , he 'd have met a fully grown werewolf -- but your father , who 'd heard what Sirius had done , went after Snape and pulled him back , at great risk to his life ... Snape glimpsed me , though , at the end of the tunnel . He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody , but from that time on he knew what I was ... '' 
`` So that 's why Snape does n't like you , '' 
`` because he thought you were in on the joke ? '' 
`` If I had n't been here to save your skin -- '' 
`` Professor Lupin could have killed me about a hundred times this year , '' 
`` YOURE PATHETIC ! '' 
`` Like father , like son , Potter ! I have just saved your neck ; you should be thanking me on bended knee ! You would have been well served if he 'd killed you ! You 'd have died like your father , too arrogant to believe you might be mistaken in Black -- now get out of the way , or I will make you . GET OUT OF THE WAY , POTTER ! '' 
`` You should have left him to me ... '' 
`` He tried to bring Peter to me , but could n't ... so he stole the passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me ... As I understand it , he took them from a boy 's bedside table ... '' 
`` This cat -- Crookshanks , did you call him ? -- told me Peter had left blood on the sheets ... I supposed he bit himself ... Well , faking his own death had worked once . '' 
`` And why did he fake his death ? '' 
`` Then I should 've let Snape take you ! '' 
`` THAT 'S NOT TRUE ! '' 
`` HE WAS THEIR SECRET-KEEPER ! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP . HE SAID HE KILLED THEM ! '' 
`` Harry ... I as good as killed them , '' 
`` I persuaded Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment , persuaded them to use him as Secret-Keeper instead of me ... I 'm to blame , I know it ... The night they died , I 'd arranged to check on Peter , make sure he was still safe , but when I arrived at his hiding place , he 'd gone . Yet there was no sign of a struggle . It did n't feel right . I was scared . I set out for your parents ' house straight away . And when I saw their house , destroyed , and their bodies ... I realized what Peter must 've done ... what I 'd done ... '' 
`` you do n't believe him , do you ... ? He tried to kill me , Remus ... '' 
'' Pettigrew was shaking his head , mouthing noiselessly , but staring all the while at Black as though hypnotized . '' 
`` So you see , I had to do something . I was the only one who knew Peter was still alive ... '' 
`` Believe me , Harry . I never betrayed James and Lily . I would have died before I betrayed them . '' 
`` And yet -- is it good for him to be given so much special treatment ? Personally , I try and treat him like any other student . And any other student would be suspended -- at the very least -- for leading his friends into such danger . Consider , Minister -- against all school rules -- after all the precautions put in place for his protection -- out-of-bounds , at night , consorting with a werewolf and a murderer -- and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too -- '' 
`` Well , well ... we shall see , Snape , we shall see ... The boy has undoubtedly been foolish ... '' 
`` What amazes me most is the behavior of the dementors ... you 've really no idea what made them retreat , Snape ? '' 
`` How 's Ron ? '' 
`` Professor Lupin can tell you -- '' 
`` Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest , unable to tell anyone anything . By the time he is human again , it will be too late , Sirius will be worse than dead . I might add that werewolves are so mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very little -- and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends -- '' 
`` But I have no power to make other men see the truth , or to overrule the Minister of Magic ... '' 
`` Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick 's office on the seventh floor . Thirteenth window from the right of the West Tower . If all goes well , you will be able to save more than one innocent life tonight . But remember this , both of you : you must not be seen . Miss Granger , you know the law -- you know what is at stake ... You -- must -- not -- be -- seen . '' 
`` Quick ! '' 
`` What are we doing ? '' 
`` Three hours back ... '' 
`` Are you telling me , '' 
`` that we 're here in this cupboard and we 're out there too ? '' 
'' Hermione was still looking at him as though worried about his sanity . I know it sounds crazy , '' 
`` we 've got to stay put . We must n't be seen . There 's nothing we can do ... '' 
`` Quick ! Where are we going to go ? Where are we going to hide ? The dementors wilt be coming any moment -- '' 
`` Back to Hagrid 's ! '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` I think I 'd better go outside again , you know , '' 
`` I 'm not going to try and interfere , '' 
`` D' you reckon he 's up there yet ? '' 
`` Macnair ! '' 
`` Ready ? '' 
`` Sirius , you 'd better go , quick , '' 
`` How can I ever thank -- '' 
`` GO ! '' 
`` We 'll see each other again , '' 
`` You are -- truly your father 's son , Harry ... '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` We did it ! '' 
`` Yes , I think you 've gone too -- get inside -- I 'll lock you in -- '' 
`` Really -- they 'll wake everybody up ! What do they think they 're doing ? '' 
`` He 's packing ? '' 
'' '' 
`` I do n't want a connection with Pettigrew ! '' 
`` This is magic at its deepest , its most impenetrable , Harry . But trust me ... the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew 's life . '' 
`` I knew your father very well , both at Hogwarts and later , Harry , '' 
`` He would have saved Pettigrew too , I am sure of it . '' 
'' ... roaring along like maniacs , the young hoodlums , '' 
'' Dudley and Piers sniggered . I know they do n't , '' 
`` It was only a dream . '' 
`` as it 's mine . '' 
`` Where 's my letter ? '' 
`` It was not a mistake , '' 
`` it had my cupboard on it . '' 
'' The Dursleys ' house had four bedrooms : one for Vernon Dursley and Aunt Petunia , one for visitors -LRB- usually Vernon Dursley 's sister , Marge -RRB- , one where Dudley slept , and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that would n't fit into his first bedroom . It only took Harry one trip upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room . He sat down on the bed and stared around him . Nearly everything in here was broken . The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small , working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor 's dog ; in the corner was Dudley 's first-ever television set , which he 'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled ; there was a large birdcage , which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air rifle , which was up on a shelf with the end all bent because Dudley had sat on it . Other shelves were full of books . They were the only things in the room that looked as though they 'd never been touched . From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother , I do n't want him in there ... I need that room ... make him get out ... '' 
`` Dudley -- go -- just go . '' 
`` Who are you ? '' 
`` True , I have n't introduced meself . Rubeus Hagrid , Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts . '' 
`` What about that tea then , eh ? '' 
`` I 'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh 've got it , mind . '' 
`` I 'm sorry , but I still do n't really know who you are . '' 
`` Call me Hagrid , '' 
`` Got ta get up ter town , get all yer books an ' that . '' 
`` You can kip under that , '' 
`` Don ' mind if it wriggles a bit , I think I still got a couple o ' dormice in one o ' the pockets . '' 
`` The little bronze ones . '' 
`` Best be Off , Harry , lots ter do today , got ta get up ter London an ' buy all yer stuff fer school . '' 
`` Right , stand back , Harry . '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` the new Nimbus Two Thousand -- fastest ever -- '' 
`` Gringotts , '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` What 's the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen ? '' 
`` Sorry , '' 
`` but what 's curious ? '' 
`` I remember every wand I 've ever sold , Harry Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather -- just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why , its brother gave you that scar . '' 
`` Yes , thirteen-and-a-half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember ... I think we must expect great things from you , Harry Potter ... After all , He - Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- terrible , yes , but great . '' 
`` Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves , '' 
`` Everyone thinks I 'm special , '' 
`` Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , '' 
`` Thank you . '' 
`` Funny way to get to a wizards ' school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o'clock , '' 
`` Why are you going to London ? '' 
`` Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . '' 
`` Excuse me , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Er -- okay , '' 
`` Oh , Neville , '' 
`` Yes , please , '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Bye , '' 
`` And have you really got -- you know ... '' 
`` Starving , '' 
`` Swap you for one of these , '' 
`` Go on , have a pasty , '' 
`` What are these ? '' 
`` They 're not really frogs , are they ? '' 
`` Oh , of course , you would n't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect -- famous witches and wizards . I 've got about five hundred , but I have n't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . '' 
`` So this is Dumbledore ! '' 
`` Has anyone seen a toad ? Neville 's lost one , '' 
`` Am I ? '' 
`` What house are your brothers in ? '' 
`` You know , I think the ends of Scabbers ' whiskers are a bit lighter , '' 
`` So what do your oldest brothers do now that they 've left , anyway ? '' 
`` Did you hear about Gringotts ? It 's been all over the Daily Prophet , but I do n't suppose you get that with the Muggles -- someone tried to rob a high security vault . '' 
`` Nothing , that 's why it 's such big news . They have n't been caught . My dad says it must 've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts , but they do n't think they took anything , that 's what 's odd . ` Course , everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case Voldemort 's behind it . '' 
`` Voldemort '' 
`` Er -- I do n't know any , '' 
`` Is it true ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` You 'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others , Potter . You do n't want to go making friends with the wrong sort . I can help you there . '' 
`` I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , '' 
`` Unless you 're a bit politer you 'll go the same way as your parents . They did n't know what was good for them , either . You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid , and it 'll rub off on you . '' 
`` Unless you get out now , '' 
`` Is he -- a bit mad ? '' 
`` He 's a genius ! Best wizard in the world ! But he is a bit mad , yes . Potatoes , Harry ? '' 
`` Ca n't you -- ? '' 
`` Ouch ! '' 
`` Who 's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? '' 
`` Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he 's looking so nervous , that 's Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n't want to -- everyone knows he 's after Quirrell 's job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . '' 
`` Get off , Scabbers ! He 's chewing my sheets . '' 
`` An ' as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I 'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D'yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it . '' 
`` I liked him a lot -- great with animals . '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` that Gringotts break-in happened on my birthday ! It might 've been happening while we were there ! '' 
`` Typical , '' 
`` Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . '' 
`` Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up . '' 
`` The boy 's a natural . I 've never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ? '' 
`` I start training next week , '' 
`` You 're a lot braver now that you 're back on the ground and you 've got your little friends with you , '' 
`` What is a wizard 's duel ? '' 
`` But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy 'll be able to do is send sparks at each other . Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage . I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . '' 
`` And it 's really none of your business , '' 
`` Shut up , both of you ! '' 
`` This way ! '' 
`` RUN ! '' 
`` I think we 've lost him , '' 
`` He thinks this door is locked , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Never mind that -- pig snout , pig snout , '' 
`` Three Chasers , '' 
`` The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , '' 
`` Never mind , '' 
`` Three Chasers , one Keeper , '' 
`` And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? '' 
`` Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , '' 
`` Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? '' 
`` It 's the girls ' bathroom ! '' 
`` Confuse it ! '' 
`` Come on , run , run ! '' 
`` Urgh -- troll boogers . '' 
`` I 'm with Harry . I would n't put anything past Snape . But what 's he after ? What 's that dog guarding ? '' 
`` I 'm not hungry . '' 
`` Thanks , Seamus , '' 
`` we were on the team last year . '' 
`` Right . It 's time . Good luck , all of you . '' 
`` Mount your brooms , please . '' 
`` I 've got the Snitch ! '' 
`` Why would Snape do somethin' like that ? '' 
`` I found out something about him , '' 
`` How do you know about Fluffy ? '' 
'' cried Hermione . The afternoon 's events certainly seemed to have changed her mind about Snape . I know a jinx when I see one , Hagrid , I 've read all about them ! You 've got to keep eye contact , and Snape was n't blinking at all , I saw him ! '' 
`` Aha ! '' 
`` so there 's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? '' 
`` Malfoy and Snape . '' 
`` Oh , we 're not working , '' 
`` Unless you 'd like to tell us and save us the trouble ? '' 
`` You can keep it , '' 
`` That 's really nice of her , '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` I 'm sure it is -- try it on . '' 
`` It is ! Look down ! '' 
`` A note fell out of it ! '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody 's been in the library Restricted Section . '' 
`` Mom ? '' 
`` Dad ? '' 
`` See ? '' 
`` Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . '' 
'' Harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice . He looked behind him . Sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore . Harry must have walked straight past him , so desperate to get to the mirror he had n't noticed him . '' 
`` The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? '' 
`` I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . '' 
`` If Filch had caught you ! '' 
`` We 've just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n't got an excuse to pick on us . '' 
`` I need to concen -- '' 
`` What 's the matter with you ? You look terrible . '' 
`` I ca n't , '' 
`` You 're worth twelve of Malfoy , '' 
`` Dumbledore again , '' 
`` He was the first one I ever - '' 
`` The what ? '' 
`` A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! '' 
`` I 'm going to play , '' 
`` Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore 's come to watch ! '' 
`` Dumbledore ? '' 
`` You know perfectly well what I mean . '' 
`` Never mind that now , '' 
`` Let 's find an empty room , you wait 'til you hear this ... '' 
`` Dittany '' 
`` There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , '' 
`` about what 's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy -- '' 
`` SHHHH ! '' 
`` Listen - come an ' see me later , I 'm not promisin ' I 'll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren ' s ` pposed ter know . They 'll think I 've told yeh -- '' 
`` See you later , then , '' 
`` Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , '' 
`` But there are n't wild dragons in Britain ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` We 've got lessons , we 'll get into trouble , and that 's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he 's doing -- '' 
`` Shut up ! '' 
`` Someone was lookin ' through the gap in the curtains -- it 's a kid -- he 's runnin ' back up ter the school . '' 
`` Just let him go , '' 
`` Hagrid , '' 
`` give it two weeks and Norbert 's going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . '' 
`` I -- I know I ca n't keep him forever , but I ca n't jus ' dump him , I ca n't . '' 
`` It 's Hedwig ! '' 
`` We 've got the invisibility cloak , '' 
`` It should n't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . '' 
`` Oh no oh no -- I 've just remembered -- Charlie 's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he 's going to know we 're getting rid of Norbert . '' 
`` It 's too late to change the plan now , '' 
`` I wo n't let you in , '' 
`` Norbert 's at a tricky stage -- nothin ' I ca n't handle . '' 
`` An ' I 've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . '' 
`` Nearly there ! '' 
`` Do n't , '' 
`` I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag -- '' 
`` It does n't take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I 've already caught him . I suppose you think it 's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? '' 
`` Fifty ? '' 
`` Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . '' 
`` Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? '' 
`` I knew it , '' 
`` A werewolf ? '' 
`` How are yeh ? '' 
`` Well , if either of you do see anythin ' , let me know , wo n't yeh ? We 'll be off , then . '' 
`` D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? '' 
`` Stay on the path , I 'll come back for yeh ! '' 
`` but he 'll have a harder time frightenin ' you , an ' we 've got ta get this done . '' 
`` Look -- '' 
`` You are the Potter boy , '' 
`` So light a fire ! '' 
`` Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , '' 
`` This way , '' 
`` Probably , '' 
`` They do n't look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once ... well , there 's no other choice ... I 'll run . '' 
`` They 're not birds ! '' 
`` They 're keys ! Winged keys -- look carefully . So that must mean ... '' 
'' ... yes -- look ! Broomsticks ! We 've got to catch the key to the door ! '' 
`` That one ! '' 
`` We 've got to close in on it ! '' 
`` Ready ? '' 
`` Now what do we do ? '' 
`` This needs thinking about he said . I suppose we 've got to take the place of three of the black pieces ... '' 
`` We 're nearly there , '' 
'' said Quirrell coolly . '' 
`` So what happened to you two ? '' 
`` No , it is n't , '' 
`` Oh , good , '' 
`` It 's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault ! '' 
'' said Dumbledore . The room went deadly quiet for pure nerve and outstanding courage , I award Gryffindor house sixty points . '' 
`` Very , '' 
`` Oh , I will , ''
