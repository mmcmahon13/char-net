`` Albus Dumbledore was beside himself at Ariana 's death . It was so dreadful for those two brothers . They had lost everybody except each other . No wonder tempers ran a little high . Aberforth blamed Albus Dumbledore , you know , as people will under these dreadful circumstances . But Aberforth always talked a little madly , poor boy . All the same , breaking Albus Dumbledore 's nose t the funeral was not decent . It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting like that , across her daughter 's body . A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the funeral ... He would have been a comfort to Albus Dumbledore , at least ... ''
