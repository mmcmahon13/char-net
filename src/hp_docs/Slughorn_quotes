`` Harry ! '' 
`` My word , '' 
`` And now , Harry , let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress , adventure . '' 
`` He has been replaced , as I am sure you also saw , by Rufus Scrimgeour , who used to be Head of the Auror office . '' 
`` Please , '' 
`` So that 's how you thought you 'd persuade me , is it ? Well , the answer 's no , Albus Dumbledore . '' 
`` For old time 's sake ? '' 
`` All right then , one drink , '' 
`` Not so well , '' 
`` You ca n't have had more than three minutes ' warning ? '' 
`` Two . Did n't hear my Intruder Charm go off , I was taking a bath . Still , '' 
`` the fact remains that I 'm an old man , Albus Dumbledore . A tired old man who 's earned the right to a quiet life and a few creature comforts . '' 
`` Well , maybe you ought to think about retirement yourself , '' 
`` That 's what she did , did she ? '' 
`` Are you leaving ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Hmpf . Yes , well . You should n't have favorites as a teacher , of CHAPTER FOUR ` 70 ` course , but she was one of mine . Your mother , '' 
`` I was Head of Slytherin , '' 
`` Oh , now , '' 
`` Funny how that sometimes happens , is n't it ? '' 
`` Not really , '' 
`` Of course not , '' 
`` And I suppose one could argue that as I have not joined the Death Eaters , He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named can hardly count me a friend ... in which case , I might well be safer a little closer to Albus Dumbledore ... I can not pretend that Amelia Bones 's death did not shake me ... If she , with all her Ministry contacts and protection ... '' 
`` Oh , there you are , Albus Dumbledore , '' 
`` Yes , yes , '' 
`` I 'll want a pay rise , Dumbledore ! '' 
`` Private -- with you ? '' 
`` it is time for us to start work . '' 
`` Oho , '' 
`` Yes . That . Well , that one , ladies and gentlemen , is a most curious little potion called Felix Felicis . I take it , '' 
`` Quite right , take another ten points for Gryffindor . Yes , it 's a funny little potion , Felix Felicis , '' 
`` Because if taken in excess , it causes giddiness , recklessness , and dangerous overconfidence , '' 
`` Twice in my life , '' 
`` Once when I was twentyfour , once when I was fifty-seven . Two tablespoonfuls taken with breakfast . Two perfect days . '' 
`` And that , '' 
`` is what I shall be offering as a prize in this lesson . '' 
`` One tiny bottle of Felix Felicis , '' 
`` So , '' 
`` how are you to win my fabulous prize ? Well , by turning to page ten of Advanced PotionMaking . We have a little over an hour left to us , which should be time for you to make a decent attempt at the Draught of Living Death . I know it is more complex than anything you have attempted before , and I do not expect a perfect potion from anybody . The person who does best , however , will win little Felix here . Off you go ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Stop stirring , please ! '' 
`` Come in , come in , so many people I 'd like you to meet ! '' 
`` Ah , Sybill , we all think our subject 's most important ! '' 
`` But I do n't think I 've ever known such a natural at Potions ! '' 
`` I was just talking about Harry 's exceptional potion-making ! Some credit must go to you , of course , you taught him for five years ! '' 
`` That 's all right , Argus , that 's all right , '' 
`` It 's nothing , nothing , '' 
`` Oh , now , Severus , '' 
`` it 's Christmas , do n't be too hard -- '' 
`` I 'm his Head of House , and I shall decide how hard , or otherwise , to be , '' 
`` All too young to Apparate just yet ? '' 
`` Ah well , '' 
`` as we 're so few , we 'll do something fun . I want you all to brew me up something amusing ! '' 
`` Oh , surprise me , '' 
`` passable . '' 
`` I do thank you for taking the time , Pomona , '' 
`` most authorities agree that they are at their most efficacious if picked at twilight . '' 
`` Plenty , plenty , '' 
`` Merlin 's beard , Harry , you made me jump , '' 
`` But I know that Dumbledore trusts Hagrid to the hilt , so I 'm sure he ca n't be up to anything very dreadful ... '' 
`` Well , it 's this giant spider , he 's had it for years ... It lived in the forest ... It could talk and everything -- '' 
`` I heard rumors there were acromantulas in the forest , '' 
`` Touching , touching , '' 
`` I tell you what , Harry , I 'll meet you down there with a bottle or two ... We 'll drink the poor beast 's -- well -- not health -- but we 'll send it off in style , anyway , once it 's buried . And I 'll change my tie , this one is a little exuberant for the occasion ... '' 
`` Snape ! '' 
`` But will we have a single pupil after this ? ''
