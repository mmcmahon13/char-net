`` No , no , I 'm a half-blood , I 'm a half-blood , I tell you ! My father was a wizard , he was , look him up , Arkie Alderton , he 's a well-known broomstick designer , look him up , I tell you -- get your hands off me , get your hands off -- '' 
`` This is your final warning , '' 
`` Take him away , '' 
`` Next -- Mary Cattermole , '' 
`` Sit down , '' 
`` You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole ? '' 
`` I do n't know where he is , he was supposed to meet me here ! '' 
`` A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today , Mrs. Cattermole , '' 
`` Eight-and-three-quarter inches , cherry , unicorn-hair core . Do you recognize that description ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` no , I do n't think so , Mrs. Cattermole . Wands only choose witches or wizards . You are not a witch . I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here -- Mafalda , pass them to me . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Oh yes -- an old family heirloom , '' 
`` The S stands for Selwyn ... I am related to the Selwyns ... Indeed , there are few pure blood families to whom I am not related ... A pity , '' 
`` Hem , hem , '' 
`` for those kind words of welcome . '' 
`` Hem , hem '' 
`` Well , it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts , I must say ! '' 
`` Hem , hem '' 
`` Hem , hem '' 
`` ... because some changes will be for the better , while others will come , in the fullness of time , to be recognized as errors of judgment . Meanwhile , some old habits will be retained , and rightly so , whereas others , outmoded and outworn , must be abandoned . Let us move forward , then , into a new era of openness , effectiveness , and accountability , intent on preserving what ought to be preserved , perfecting CHAPTER ELEVEN ` 214 ` what needs to be perfected , and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited . '' 
`` He was a good Keeper ... '' 
`` Still , it wo n't hurt to have some new blood , will it ? '' 
`` Could n't you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own ? '' 
`` So ? She could 've done , I was n't stopping -- '' 
`` You will be pleased to know , however , that these problems are now to be rectified . We will be following a carefully structured , theorycentered , Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year . Copy down the following , please . '' 
`` Has everybody got a copy of Defensive Magical Theory by Wilbert Slinkhard ? '' 
`` Basics for Beginners . '' 
`` Did you want to ask something about the chapter , dear ? '' 
`` Dean Thomas . '' 
`` I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school , '' 
`` but you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class , very irresponsible indeed -- not to mention , '' 
`` extremely dangerous half-breeds . '' 
`` Now , it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination , which , after all , is what school is all about . And your name is ? '' 
`` This is school , Harry Potter , not the real world , '' 
`` Now , let me make a few things quite plain . '' 
`` Cedric Diggory 's death was a tragic accident , '' 
`` Come here , Harry Potter , dear . '' 
`` Every evening this week ! '' 
`` No , I 'm sorry , they 've gone too far , '' 
`` I 'll tell you what now , '' 
`` Come in , '' 
`` Well , sit down , '' 
`` Oh no , '' 
`` There , '' 
`` we 're getting better at controlling our temper already , are n't we ? Now , you are going to be doing some lines for me , Harry Potter . No , not with your quill , '' 
`` You 're going to be using a rather special one of mine . Here you are . '' 
`` I want you to write ` I must not tell lies , ' '' 
`` Oh , as long as it takes for the message to sink in , '' 
`` Off you go . '' 
`` Hand , '' 
`` Tut , tut , I do n't seem to have made much of an impression yet , '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` Good . That ought to serve as a reminder to you , ought n't it ? You may leave for tonight . '' 
`` Do I still have to come back tomorrow ? '' 
`` Ron ? '' 
`` You know what to do , Harry Potter , '' 
`` Let 's see if you 've gotten the message yet , shall we ? '' 
`` Yes , it hurts , does n't it ? '' 
`` Great , '' 
`` HIGH INQUISITOR '' 
`` ` High Inquisitor ' ? '' 
`` We shall be continuing our study of prophetic dreams today , '' 
`` Divide into pairs , please , and interpret each other 's latest nighttime visions with the aid of the Oracle . '' 
`` Now , '' 
`` you 've been in this post how long , exactly ? '' 
`` Nearly sixteen years . '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` Well , if you could just predict something for me , then ? '' 
`` The Inner Eye does not See upon command ! '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Well , if that 's really the best you can do ... '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Let me see the start you 've made on your dream diary , please . '' 
`` Wands away , '' 
`` As we finished chapter one last lesson , I would like you all to turn to page nineteen today and commence chapter two , ` Common Defensive Theories and Their Derivation . ' There will be no need to talk . '' 
`` I think another week 's detentions would do you some good , Mr. Potter , '' 
`` That will do , '' 
`` how you expect to gain an idea of my usual teaching methods if you continue to interrupt me ? You see , I do not generally permit people to talk when I am talking . '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` you will receive the results of your inspection in ten days ' time . '' 
`` No , I 'm very happy with the way things are run , very happy indeed . '' 
`` And what are you planning to cover with this class this year -- assuming , of course , that Professor Hagrid does not return ? '' 
`` you '' 
`` Another night 's detention , I think , '' 
`` Well , the class seems fairly advanced for their level , '' 
`` Now ... how long have you been teaching at Hogwarts ? '' 
`` Do you have any idea why Dumbledore has consistently refused to appoint you ? '' 
`` Yes , the Ministry wants a thorough understanding of teachers ' -- er -- backgrounds ... '' 
`` She obviously reckons Trelawney 's an old fraud too ... Looks like she 's put her on probation . '' 
`` I think they deserve rather more than detentions , '' 
`` Well , actually , Minerva , '' 
`` I think you 'll find that what I think does count . Now , where is it ? Cornelius just sent it ... I mean , '' 
`` the Minister just sent it ... Ah yes ... '' 
`` Well , yes , '' 
`` As a matter of fact , Minerva , it was you who made me see that we needed a further amendment ... You remember how you overrode me , when I was unwilling to allow the Gryffindor Quidditch team to re-form ? How you took the case to Dumbledore , who insisted that the team be allowed to play ? Well , now , I could n't have that . I contacted the Minister at once , and he quite agreed with me that the High Inquisitor has to have the power to strip pupils of privileges , or she -- that is to say , I -- would have less authority than common teachers ! And you see now , do n't you , Minerva , how right I was in attempting to stop the Gryffindor team re-forming ? Dreadful tempers ... Anyway , I was reading out our amendment ... hem , hem ... ` The High Inquisitor will henceforth have supreme authority over all punishments , sanctions , and removal of privileges pertaining to the students of Hogwarts , and the power to alter such punishments , sanctions , and removals of privileges as may have been ordered by other staff members . Signed , Cornelius Fudge , Minister of Magic , Order of Merlin First Class , etc. , etc. ... ' '' 
`` So ... I really think I will have to ban these two from playing Quidditch ever again , '' 
`` Yes , Harry Potter , I think a lifelong ban ought to do the trick , '' 
`` You and Mr. Weasley here . And I think , to be safe , this young man 's twin ought to be stopped too -- if his teammates had not restrained him , I feel sure he would have attacked young Lucius as well . I will want their broomsticks confiscated , of course ; I shall keep them safely in my office , to make THE LION AND THE SERPENT ` 417 ` sure there is no infringement of my ban . But I am not unreasonable , Professor Minerva McGonagall , '' 
`` The rest of the team can continue playing , I saw no signs of violence from any of them . Well ... good afternoon to you . '' 
`` Erm ... '' 
`` Where have you been ? '' 
`` Been , yes , '' 
`` For your health , '' 
`` Mountain scenery ? '' 
`` Really ? '' 
`` You ought to know too that as High Inquisitor it is my unfortunate but necessary duty to inspect my fellow teachers . So I daresay we shall meet again soon enough . '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` The Ministry is determined to weed out unsatisfactory teachers , Hagrid . Good night . '' 
`` You received the note I sent to your cabin this morning ? '' 
`` I 'm sorry ? '' 
`` ` has ... to ... resort ... to ... crude ... sign ... language ... ' '' 
`` Well ... anyway ... '' 
`` ` Appears ... to ... have ... poor ... short ... term ... memory ... ' '' 
`` Thestrals aren ' dangerous ! All righ , they might take a bite outta you if yeh really annoy them -- '' 
`` ` Shows ... signs ... of ... pleasure ... at ... idea ... of ... violence ... ' '' 
`` I mean , a dog 'll bite if yeh bait it , won ' it -- but thestrals have jus ' got a bad reputation because o ' the death thing -- people used ter think they were bad omens , didn ' they ? Jus ' didn ' understand , did they ? '' 
`` No ... because ... well ... it sounds ... like grunting a lot of the time ... '' 
`` You can see the thestrals , Longbottom , can you ? '' 
`` Whom did you see die ? '' 
`` And what do you think of them ? '' 
`` Well , they 're ... er ... okay ... '' 
`` ` Students ... are ... too ... intimidated ... to ... admit ... they ... are ... frightened ... ' '' 
`` It 's quite all right , '' 
`` Well , Hagrid , '' 
`` the results of your inspection '' 
`` in ten days ' time . '' 
`` Why have you got all these letters , Harry Potter ? '' 
`` Be careful , Mr. Weasley , or I shall have to put you in detention , '' 
`` An interview ? '' 
`` When did you do this ? '' 
`` There will be no more Hogsmeade trips for you , Harry Potter , '' 
`` How you dare ... how you could ... '' 
`` I have tried again and again to teach you not to tell lies . The message , apparently , has still not sunk in . Fifty points from Gryffindor and another week 's worth of detentions . '' 
`` I 'm really , really sorry . That interview was so brave ... it made me cry . '' 
`` Oh really , Professor Minerva McGonagall ? '' 
`` Yours , Professor Dumbledore ? '' 
`` I 'm afraid you do not understand the position . I have here '' 
`` an Order of Dismissal signed by myself and the Minister of Magic . Under the terms of Educational Decree Number Twenty-three , the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts has the power to inspect , place upon probation , and sack any teacher she -- that is to say , I -- feel is not performing up to the standard required by the Ministry of Magic . I have decided that Professor Trelawney is not up to scratch . I have dismissed her . '' 
`` And what , '' 
`` are you going to do with her once I appoint a new Divination teacher who needs her lodgings ? '' 
`` You 've found -- ? '' 
`` I have testimony from Willy Widdershins , Minerva , who happened to be in the bar at the time . He was heavily bandaged , it is true , but his hearing was quite unimpaired , '' 
`` was to persuade them to join an illegal society , whose aim was to learn spells and curses the Ministry has decided are inappropriate for school-age -- '' 
`` I think you 'll find you 're wrong there , Dolores , '' 
`` That 's all very fine , Headmaster , '' 
`` Evidence ? '' 
`` Miss Edgecombe , '' 
`` tell us how long these meetings have been going on , dear . You can simply nod or shake your head , I 'm sure that wo n't make the spots worse . Have they been happening regularly over the last six months ? '' 
`` What do you mean by shaking your head , dear ? '' 
`` But there was a meeting tonight ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` yes ... well , Miss Edgecombe tipped me off and I proceeded at once to the seventh floor , accompanied by certain trustworthy students , so as to catch those in the meeting red-handed . It appears that they were forewarned of my arrival , however , because when we reached the seventh floor they were running in every direction . It does not matter , however . I have all their names here , Miss Parkinson ran into the Room of Requirement for me to see if they had left anything behind ... We needed evidence and the room provided ... '' 
`` The moment I saw Potter 's name on the list , I knew what we were dealing with , '' 
`` Well -- it 's just that you seem to be laboring under the delusion that I am going to -- what is the phrase ? ` Come quietly ' I am afraid I am not going to come quietly at all , Cornelius . I have absolutely no intention of being sent to Azkaban . I could break out , of course -- but what a waste of time , and frankly , I can think of a whole host of things I would rather be doing . '' 
`` Journey was fine , journey was fine , we 've made it plenty of times before ! '' 
`` Now , I have n't heard from Dumbledore lately ! '' 
`` None at all , '' 
`` Get him , get him ! '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` Ah , Professor Snape , '' 
`` Surely you did not use it all ? I told you that three drops would be sufficient . '' 
`` You can make some more , ca n't you ? '' 
`` A month ? '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` Very well ... I am left with no alternative ... This is more than a matter of school discipline ... This is an issue of Ministry security ... Yes ... yes ... '' 
`` You are forcing me , Potter ... I do not want to , '' 
`` but sometimes circumstances justify the use ... I am sure the Minister will understand that I had no choice ... '' 
`` The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue , '' 
`` Professor Umbridge -- it 's illegal '' 
`` What Cornelius does n't know wo n't hurt him , '' 
`` Somebody had to act , '' 
`` They were all bleating about silencing you somehow -- discrediting you -- but I was the one who actually did something about it ... Only you wriggled out of that one , did n't you , Potter ? Not today , though , not now ... '' 
`` Cruc -- '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` Well , well , well ! '' 
`` That 's right , that 's right , girl ! '' 
`` Dumbledore ? '' 
`` Idiot girl , Dumbledore wo n't be sitting in a pub when the whole Ministry 's looking for him ! '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` What 's ready ? '' 
`` Weapon ? Weapon ? '' 
`` What kind of weapon is it ? '' 
`` We j-j-just did what P-P-Professor Dumbledore told us t-t-to do ... '' 
`` In any case , it does not sound as though this weapon is something that schoolchildren should see . You will remain here until I return and make sure none of these '' 
`` And you two can go ahead of me and show me the way , '' 
`` It 's hidden in Hagrid 's hut , is it ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Yes , he would have done , of course , the great half-breed oaf ... '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` No , I do n't think so , Harry Potter , '' 
`` Is it very far in ? '' 
`` I am Dolores Umbridge ! '' 
`` That 's right ! '' 
`` Law Fifteen B states clearly that ` Any attack by a magical creature who is deemed to have near-human intelligence , and therefore considered responsible for its actions -- ' '' 
`` ` Near-human intelligence ' ? '' 
`` Your forest ? '' 
`` I would remind you that you live FIGHT AND FLIGHT ` 755 ` here only because the Ministry of Magic permits you certain areas of land -- '' 
`` Filthy half-breeds ! '' 
`` Incarcerous ! '' 
`` No ... no ... '' 
`` no , I must have been dreaming ... ''
