`` We can actually meet him ! '' 
`` He had no idea , '' 
`` It 's a simple matter if you know what you 're doing ! '' 
`` If you need help , you know where I am ! I 'll let you have a copy of my book . I 'm surprised you have n't already got one - I 'll sign one tonight and send it over . Well , good-bye ! '' 
`` You , too , Harry Potter , Mr. Weasley , Miss Granger . '' 
`` She 's not dead , Argus , '' 
`` I 'll make it , '' 
`` So clever , the way you trapped that last one with the tea-strainer - '' 
`` Well , I 'm sure no one will mind me giving the best student of the year a little extra help , '' 
`` Yes , nice , is n't it ? '' 
`` So , Harry , '' 
`` I do n't want a photo of this , Colin , '' 
`` Lie back , Harry , '' 
`` Stand back , '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` Let me introduce my assistant , Professor Snape , '' 
`` As you see , we are holding our wands in the accepted combative position , '' 
`` Well , there you have it ! '' 
`` Enough demonstrating ! I 'm going to come amongst you now and put you all into pairs . Professor Snape , if you 'd like to help me - '' 
`` Face your partners ! '' 
`` Wands at the ready ! '' 
`` I said disarm only ! '' 
`` Stop ! Stop ! '' 
`` Dear , dear , '' 
`` Allow me ! '' 
`` Do n't you people realize , '' 
`` the danger has passed ! The culprit has been taken away - '' 
`` My dear young man , the Minister of Magic would n't have taken Hagrid if he had n't been one hundred percent sure that he was guilty , '' 
`` I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid 's arrest than you do , Mr. Weasley , '' 
`` Why do n't you leave us here , sir , we 've only got one more corridor to go - '' 
`` You know , Weasley , I think I will , '' 
`` I really should go and prepare my next class - '' 
`` The very man . A girl has been snatched by the monster , Lockhart . Taken into the Chamber of Secrets itself . Your moment has come at last . '' 
`` Were n't you saying just last night that you 've known all along where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is ? '' 
`` Did n't you say that the whole affair had been bungled , and that you should have been given a free rein from the first ? '' 
`` Tonight will be an excellent time to do it . We 'll make sure everyone 's out of your way . You 'll be able to tackle the monster all by youself . A free rein at last . '' 
`` V very well , '' 
`` I 'll - I 'll be in my office , getting getting ready . '' 
`` Oh - Harry Potter - Mr. Weasley - '' 
`` Er - well - it 's not terribly - '' 
`` Er , well , yes , '' 
`` Well , as to that - most unfortunate - '' 
`` Well - I must say - when I took the job - '' 
`` After all that stuff you did in your books - '' 
`` Books can be misleading , '' 
`` My dear boy , '' 
`` Harry , Harry , '' 
`` it 's not nearly as simple as that . There was work involved . I had * 297 * to track these people down . Ask them exactly how they managed to do what they did . Then I had to put a Memory Charm on them so they would n't remember doing it . If there 's one thing I pride myself on , it 's my Memory Charms . No , it 's been a lot of work , Harry . It 's not all book signings and publicity photos , you know . You want fame , you have to be prepared for a long hard slog . '' 
`` Let 's see , '' 
`` I think that 's everything . Yes . Only one thing left . '' 
`` What d'you want me to do ? '' 
`` We think we know where it is . And what 's inside it . Let 's go . '' 
`` Well , you hardly seem to need me , '' 
`` I 'll just - '' 
`` Boys , '' 
`` I really do n't think - ''
