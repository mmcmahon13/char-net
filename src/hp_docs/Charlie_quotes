`` He 'll be okay , he only got ploughed ! '' 
`` The Snitch , where 's the Snitch ? '' 
`` Dad , what 's going on ? '' 
`` This is a Hungarian Horntail , '' 
`` There 's a Common Welsh Green over there , the smaller one -- a Swedish ShortSnout , that blue-gray -- and a Chinese Fireball , that 's the red . '' 
`` I did n't know you were bringing her , Hagrid , '' 
`` Really romantic date , Hagrid , '' 
`` Just get past them , I think , '' 
`` We 'll be on hand if it gets nasty , Extinguishing Spells at the ready . They wanted nesting mothers , I do n't know why ... but I tell you this , I do n't envy the one who gets the Horntail . Vicious thing . Its back end 's as dangerous as its front , look . '' 
`` I 've got them counted , Hagrid , '' 
`` How 's Harry ? '' 
`` Just hope he 's still fine after he 's faced this lot , '' 
`` I did n't dare tell Mum what he 's got to do for the first task ; she 's already having kittens about him ... ''
