`` Bought it from Dung ' bout a year ago , '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` I got food , '' 
`` Right then , '' 
`` Do n't be stupid , boy , '' 
`` What you 've got to do , '' 
`` is to get as far from here as from here as you can . '' 
`` You do n't understand . There is n't much time . We 've got to get into the castle . Dumbledore -- I mean , your brother -- wanted us -- '' 
`` My brother Albus Dumbledore wanted a lot of things , '' 
`` and people had a habit of getting hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans . You get away from this school , Potter , and out of the country if you can . Forget my brother 477 and his clever schemes . He 's gone where none of this can hurt him , and you do n't owe him anything . '' 
`` But you 're fighting too , you 're in the Order of the Phoenix -- '' 
`` I was , '' 
`` And my father went after the bastards that did it , '' 
'' and attacked them . And they locked him up in Azkaban for it . He never said why he 'd done it , because the Ministry had known what Ariana had become , she 'd have been locked up in St. Mungo 's for good . They 'd have seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy , unbalanced like she was , with magic exploding out of her at moments when she could n't keep it in any longer . '' 
`` Then , when she was fourteen ... See , I was n't there . '' 
`` So that put paid to Albus Dumbledore 's trip round the world with little Doge . The pair of ’em came home for my mother 's funeral and then Doge went off on his own , and Albus Dumbledore settled down as head of the family . Ha ! '' 
`` I 'd have looked after her , I told him so , I did n't care about school , I 'd have stayed home and done it . He told me I had to finish my education and he 'd take over from my mother . Bit of a comedown for Mr. Brilliant , there 's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister , stopping her blowing up the house every other day . But he did all right for a few weeks ... till he came . '' 
`` And there was an argument ... and I pulled my wand , and he pulled out his , and I had the Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother 's best friend -- and Albus Dumbledore was trying to stop him , and then all three of us were dueling , and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off , she could n't stand it -- '' 
`` Gone , '' 
`` I beg your pardon ? '' 
`` He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana ... It was torture to him , if you 'd seen him then , you would n't say he was free . '' 
`` Ab , there might be a couple more people on the way . '' 
`` Couple more ? '' 
`` Look after ’em , then , '' 
`` He was dueling Dolohov , '' 
`` have n't seen him since ! ''
