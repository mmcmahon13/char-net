`` All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle , '' 
`` Well , there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from , you know , but as long as you 've spoken clearly - '' 
`` He 'll be fine , Molly , do n't fuss , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Ron ! '' 
`` Lucius , '' 
`` Dear me , what 's the use of being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they do n't even pay you well for it ? '' 
`` We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wizard , Malfoy , '' 
`` I noticed , in my search of the park , that considerable damage seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow , '' 
`` Often , '' 
`` when you 're in a pressured situation you can often produce magic you 've never dreamed of . Small children often find , before they 're trained -- '' 
`` No ! So why in the name of Merlin 's saggy left -- '' 
`` Do n't you talk to your mother like that , '' 
`` And do as you 're told . '' 
`` There 's no need to , er , mention it to Molly , '' 
`` You ' ave been to much trouble , '' 
`` The Minister -- but why -- ? I do n't understand -- '' 
`` Yes , of course , '' 
`` We -- we thought we heard -- '' 
`` What did he want ? '' 
`` ... I quite understand what you 're saying , Wakanda , but I 'm afraid I can not be part to -- '' 
`` Oh , hello , Reg , '' 
`` I could n't stop it , so they 've sent me to get Bernie -- Pillsworth , I think they said -- '' 
`` Yes , a lot of offices have been raining lately , '' 
`` One moment , Runcorn . '' 
`` I hear you laid information about Dirk Cresswell . '' 
`` Do n't pretend , Runcorn , '' 
`` So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are , '' 
`` Is that a threat , Runcorn ? '' 
`` I -- '' 
`` That 's a good idea , '' 
`` They must have gone up to the Great Hall already , '' 
`` Leprechauns ! '' 
`` Fingers in your ears ! '' 
`` Fool ! '' 
`` And that , boys , '' 
`` is why you should never go for looks alone ! '' 
`` Well , I think I 'll take my lot back to the tent , if nobody 's got any objections . Amos , that wand 's told us all it can -- if Harry could have it back , please -- '' 
`` Come on , you three , '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` That does n't mean she has n't got feelings , Ron . It 's disgusting the way -- '' 
`` Hermione , I agree with you , '' 
`` but now is not the time to discuss elf rights . I want to get back to the tent as fast as we can . What happened to the others ? '' 
`` I 'll explain everything back at the tent , '' 
`` Of course it 's not Him , '' 
`` We do n't know who it was ; it looks like they Disapparated . Now excuse me , please , I want to get to bed . '' 
`` Fred , George , and Ginny got back okay , but the others -- '' 
`` I 've got them here , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` And it has n't been seen for thirteen years , '' 
`` I mean ... it 's still only a shape in the sky ... '' 
`` Ron , Voldemort and his followers sent the Dark Mark into the air whenever they killed , '' 
`` The terror it inspired ... you have no idea , you 're too young . Just picture coming home and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house , and knowing what you 're about to find inside ... '' 
`` We ca n't prove it was them , Bill , '' 
`` Though it probably was , '' 
`` The point ? '' 
`` Harry , that 's their idea of fun . Half the Muggle killings back when YouKnow-Who was in power were done for fun . I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and could n't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large . A nice little reunion for them , '' 
`` Your guess is as good as ours , Hermione , '' 
`` He 'll be all right , '' 
`` you 're alive ... Oh boys ... '' 
`` It 's all I 've been thinking about ! What if Voldemort had got you , and the last thing I ever said to you was that you did n't get enough O.W.L.s ? Oh Fred ... George ... '' 
`` Come on , now , Molly , we 're all perfectly okay , '' 
`` Bill , '' 
`` pick up that paper , I want to see what it says ... '' 
`` I knew it , '' 
`` I 'm mentioned , '' 
`` Not by name , '' 
`` Listen to this : ` If the terrified wizards and witches who waited breathlessly for news at the edge of the wood expected reassurance from the Ministry of Magic , they were sadly disappointed . A Ministry official emerged some time after the appearance of the Dark Mark alleging that nobody had been hurt , but refusing to give any more information . Whether this statement will be enough to quash the rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods an hour later , remains to be seen . ' Oh really , '' 
`` Nobody was hurt . What was I supposed to say ? Rumors that several bodies were removed from the woods ... well , there certainly will be rumors now she 's printed that . '' 
`` I 've got to go , Molly , '' 
`` home '' 
`` work . '' 
`` work '' 
`` traveling '' 
`` home '' 
`` Well , the fat 's really in the fire now , '' 
`` Crouch is very lucky Rita has n't found out about Winky , '' 
`` What does Mad-Eye say happened ? '' 
`` What did the dustbins do ? '' 
`` Apparently one of them was still rocketing around when the please-men turned up -- '' 
`` Might be a caution , '' 
`` All right , I 'm off , '' 
`` I 'd better hurry -- you have a good term , boys , '' 
`` You just look after Mad-Eye , we 'll be fine . '' 
`` Mad-Eye '' 
`` traveling . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Correct , '' 
`` I know , dear , but it 's Ministry procedure , and I have to set an example . Something smells good -- onion soup ? '' 
`` Harry ! We did n't expect you until morning ! '' 
`` Of course I am ! '' 
`` Gâ€™night , Harry , '' 
`` Talking of Diagon Alley , '' 
`` looks like Ollivander 's gone too . '' 
`` Do n't get used to it , it 's only because of Harry , '' 
`` A couple of hours , I expect , '' 
`` If I were on duty ... '' 
`` I think we 'd better do Madam Malkin 's first , Hermione wants new dress robes , and Ron 's showing much too much ankle in his school robes , and you must need new ones too , Harry , you 've grown so much -- come on , everyone -- '' 
`` Molly , it does n't make sense for all of us to go to Madam Malkin 's , '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` Of course you did , '' 
`` There 's something else . We saw Malfoy jump about a mile when Madam Malkin tried to touch his left arm . I think he 's been branded with the Dark Mark . I think he 's replaced his father as a Death Eater . '' 
`` Harry , I doubt whether Voldemort would allow a sixteenyear-old -- '' 
`` Does anyone really know what Voldemort would or would n't do ? '' 
`` I doubt it , to be honest , Harry , '' 
`` Well , maybe , '' 
`` You 'd better hurry , '' 
`` Half our family does seem to owe you their lives , now I stop and think about it , '' 
`` You said Greyback attacked him ? '' 
`` And Dumbledore ... '' 
`` Dumbledore gone , '' 
`` But she wants you , '' 
`` And after all , Remus , young and whole men do not necessarily remain so . '' 
`` Harry , that 's wonderful ! Well , of course , they could n't have found you guilty , not on the evidence , but even so , I ca n't pretend I was n't -- '' 
`` Merlin 's beard , '' 
`` I 'm going to take you straight back so you can tell the others the good news , '' 
`` Cured ! '' 
`` Completely cured ! '' 
`` Merlin 's beard , '' 
`` what 's going on here ? '' 
`` But what 's been going on ? '' 
`` Yes , Molly dear , '' 
`` See you Harry , and keep an eye out for snakes for me ! '' 
`` I KNOW ! I KNOW ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` It 'd be good to get some more money -- '' 
`` Do n't be ridiculous , Ron , '' 
`` I do n't want to make him miserable , I want to put him on his guard ! '' 
`` It was as if someone had lit a fire In my head , and the dementors could n't destroy it ... It was n't a happy feeling ... it was an obsession ... but it gave me strength , it cleared my mind . So , one night when they opened my door to bring food , I slipped past them as a dog ... It 's so much harder for them to sense animal emotions that they were confused ... I was thin , very thin ... thin enough to slip through the bars ... I swam as a dog back to the mainland ... I journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog . I 've been living in the forest ever since , except when I came to watch the Quidditch , of course . You fly as well as your father did , Harry ... '' 
'' Ron went purple in the face ; he looked like a radish with a bad sunburn . ''
