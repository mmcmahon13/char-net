`` He changed , Harry , he changed ! It 's as simple as that ! Maybe he did believe those things when he was seventeen , but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts ! Dumbledore was the one who stopped 313 Grindelwald , the one who always voted for Muggle protection and Muggle born rights , who fought Voldemort from the start , and who died trying to bring him down ! '' 
`` She 's doing a small piece on the tournament for the Daily Prophet ... '' 
`` Maybe not that small , Ludo , '' 
`` I wonder if I could have a little word with Harry before we start ? '' 
`` Lovely , '' 
`` We do n't want to be in there with all that noise , '' 
`` Come along , dear -- that 's right -- lovely , '' 
`` Let 's see now ... '' 
`` Lovely , '' 
`` I do n't know how my name got into the Goblet of Fire . I did n't put it in there . '' 
`` How do you feel about the tasks ahead ? '' 
`` Champions have died in the past , have n't they ? '' 
`` Of course , you 've looked death in the face before , have n't you ? '' 
`` Can you remember your parents at all ? '' 
`` Dumbledore ! '' 
`` How are you ? '' 
`` I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat . '' 
`` Er -- yes , let 's do those first , '' 
`` er 's '' 
`` Look behind you . '' 
`` He surely does n't think we 'd care about him being half-giant ? '' 
`` Who cares if Diggory 's getting help ? '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` What did you do that to Hagrid for , eh ? '' 
`` How about giving me an interview about the Hagrid you know , Harry ? The man behind the muscles ? Your unlikely friendship and the reasons behind it . Would you call him a father substitute ? '' 
`` Sit down , you silly little girl , and do n't talk about things you do n't understand , '' 
`` Hi , Hagrid , '' 
`` Cho ? '' 
`` A girl ? '' 
`` So you can put that away right now . '' 
`` Little Miss Perfect was just about to tell me when you arrived , '' 
`` I suppose I 'm allowed to talk to him , am I ? '' 
`` What deal ? '' 
`` They 've run plenty of horrible stories about Harry this year CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE ` 566 ` without my help , '' 
`` So you actually stick to it , do you , that He-Who-Must-Not-BeNamed is back ? '' 
`` I 'd love them , '' 
`` But of course , '' 
`` You want me to report what he says about He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named ? '' 
`` There 's no market for a story like that , '' 
`` All right , Fudge is leaning on the Prophet , but it comes to the same thing . They wo n't print a story that shows Harry in a good light . Nobody wants to read it . It 's against the public mood . This last Azkaban breakout has got people quite worried enough . People just do n't want to believe Voldemort 's back . '' 
`` The Prophet exists to sell itself , you silly girl , '' 
`` He publishes important stories that he thinks the public needs to know . He does n't care about making money . '' 
`` I 'm guessing your father runs some stupid little village newsletter ? '' 
`` ` Important stories he thinks the public needs to know ' ? '' 
`` Luna says her father 's quite happy to take Harry 's interview . That 's who 'll be publishing it . '' 
`` The Quibbler ! '' 
`` They do it because it 's an honor , and , of course , to see their names in print . '' 
`` Otherwise , as you very well know , I will inform the authorities that you are an unregistered Animagus . Of course , the Prophet might give you rather a lot for an insider 's account of life in Azkaban ... '' 
`` I do n't suppose I 've got any choice , have I ? ''
