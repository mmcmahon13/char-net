`` I am fully aware that , in the ordinary course of events , you would want to take Winky into your CHAPTER NINE ` 138 ` department for questioning . I ask you , however , to allow me to deal with her . '' 
`` You may rest assured that she will be punished , '' 
`` M-m-master , p-p-please ... '' 
`` Winky has behaved tonight in a manner I would not have believed possible , '' 
`` Your elf 's scared of heights , and those wizards in masks were levitating people ! You ca n't blame her for wanting to get out of their way ! '' 
`` I have no use for a house-elf who disobeys me , '' 
`` and Mr. Ludo Bagman , Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports . '' 
`` Got to give our champions their instructions , have n't we ? Barty , want to do the honors ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` instructions . Yes ... the first task ... '' 
`` The champions are not permitted to ask for or accept help of any kind from their teachers to complete the tasks in the tournament . The champions will face the first challenge armed only with their wands . They will receive information about the second task when the first is over . Owing to the demanding and time-consuming nature of the tournament , the champions are exempted from end-of-year tests . '' 
`` No , Dumbledore , I must get back to the Ministry , '' 
`` I think not , Ludo , '' 
`` Harry Potter is too good to Dobby ! '' 
`` You say you have names for us , Karkaroff , '' 
`` Yet you say you have some names for us ? '' 
`` These names are ? '' 
`` We have already apprehended Dolohov , '' 
`` Any others ? '' 
`` Rosier is dead , '' 
`` Any more ? '' 
`` Rookwood ? '' 
`` I believe he used a network of well-placed wizards , both inside the Ministry and out , to collect information -- '' 
`` But Travers and Mulciber we have , '' 
`` Snape has been cleared by this council , '' 
`` Very well , Karkaroff , '' 
`` you have been of assistance . I shall review your case . You will return to Azkaban in the meantime ... '' 
`` Ludo Bagman , you have been brought here in front of the Council of Magical Law to answer charges relating to the activities of the Death Eaters , '' 
`` If I did n't know he 'd always been dim , I 'd have said some of those Bludgers had permanently affected his brain ... '' 
`` Ludovic Bagman , you were caught passing information to Lord Voldemort 's supporters , '' 
`` It will be put to the vote , '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` Despicable , '' 
`` Bring them in , '' 
`` You have been brought here before the Council of Magical Law , '' 
`` so that we may pass judgment on you , for a crime so heinous -- '' 
`` Father , '' 
`` Father ... please ... '' 
`` -- that we have rarely heard the like of it within this court , '' 
`` I did n't , I swear it , Father , do n't send me back to the dementors -- '' 
`` You are further accused , '' 
`` of using the Cruciatus Curse on Frank Longbottom 's wife , when he would not give you information . You planned to restore He-Who-Must-NotBe-Named to power , and to resume the lives of violence you presumably led while he was strong . I now ask the jury -- '' 
`` I now ask the jury , '' 
`` to raise their hands if they believe , as I do , that these crimes deserve a life sentence in Azkaban ! '' 
`` The Dark Lord will rise again , Crouch ! Throw us into Azkaban ; we will wait ! He CHAPTER THIRTY ` 596 ` will rise again and will come for us , he will reward us beyond any of his other supporters ! We alone were faithful ! We alone tried to find him ! '' 
`` You are no son of mine ! '' 
`` Take them away ! '' 
`` Say no more , Master Barty , say no more , you is getting your father into trouble ! '' 
`` He arrived at our house late one night in the arms of his servant Pettigrew . My master had found out that I was still alive . He had captured Bertha Jorkins in Albania . He had tortured her . She told him a great deal . She told him about the Triwizard Tournament . She told him the old Auror , Moody , was going to teach at Hogwarts . He tortured her until he broke through the Memory Charm CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE ` 688 ` my father had placed upon her . She told him I had escaped from Azkaban . She told him my father kept me imprisoned to prevent me from seeking my master . And so my master knew that I was still his faithful servant -- perhaps the most faithful of all . My master conceived a plan , based upon the information Bertha had given him . He needed me . He arrived at our house near midnight . My father answered the door . ''
