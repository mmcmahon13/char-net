`` They went for Filch first , '' 
`` What ? This ? '' 
`` This is nothing , Seamus is worse . You 'll see . Shall we get going then ? Oh , '' 
`` I know , that 's why the 'll be Apparating directly into the bar , '' 
`` Just send them down the passage when they get here , will you ? Thanks a lot . '' 
`` They sealed off all of those before the start of the year , '' 
`` There 's no chance of getting through any of them now , not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits . '' 
`` What did you do with the dragon ? '' 
`` It 's been ... well , it 's not really like Hogwarts anymore , '' 
`` They do more than teach , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` That 's how I got this one , '' 
'' ``' Course , '' 
`` Okay , okay , calm down ! '' 
`` Room of Requirement , of course ! '' 
`` Mandrakes ! '' 
`` Where are you going , alone ? '' 
`` There 's something I 've got to do . Listen -- Neville -- '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` So what if I am ? '' 
`` I 'll join you when hell freezes over , '' 
`` Dumbledore 's Army ! '' 
`` They 're even staring at us ! '' 
`` Yes , I thought Gran would be angry about all the publicity , '' 
`` but she was really pleased . Says I 'm starting to live up to my dad at long last . She bought me a new wand , look ! '' 
`` We did n't face him , though , '' 
`` Acceptable , '' 
`` You all right , Harry ? You look funny , '' 
`` Why , what happened , Seamus ? '' 
`` Anyway , your parents do n't get the Daily Prophet , they do n't know our headmaster 's been sacked from the Wizengamot and the International Confederation of Wizards because he 's losing his marbles -- '' 
`` My gran says that 's rubbish , '' 
`` Hi , Harry , '' 
`` And in our first year , '' 
`` he saved that Sorcerous Stone -- '' 
`` Sorcerer 's , '' 
`` Yes , that , from Voldemort , '' 
`` What are heliopaths ? '' 
`` Crabbe and Goyle would 've torn you apart . '' 
`` was that about ? '' 
`` Expelliarmus ! '' 
`` I DID IT ! '' 
`` My ... my grandad , '' 
`` Erm , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` no , I 'm not scared of them -- ! '' 
`` It 's the right thing to do , Harry , '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` and his Death Eaters too ... People should know ... '' 
`` Then we should come too , '' 
`` We 're coming with you , Harry , '' 
`` How 're we going to get back out ? '' 
`` Do n't , Harry , '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` EXPELLIARMUS ! '' 
`` Get out of the way , Harry ! '' 
`` STUPEFY ! '' 
`` don 'd gib it to him ! '' 
`` Whaddid he do to her ? '' 
`` I dunno ... '' 
`` And whad are you going do do ? '' 
`` Well , I ' b going do find dem wid you , ''

`` dat was by dad 's old wand ... '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` Harry ... I ' b really sorry ... '' 
`` Dey 're all back dere , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` everything 's settled right back down again . '' 
'' said Stan , clapping his hands , where abouts in London ? '' 
`` No idea -- sit down -- '' 
`` Ouch ! '' 
`` I think so , '' 
`` after you 've broken your first cup , would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones ? I 'm rather attached to the pink . '' 
`` Orange . Tell me , boy , does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours ? Did n't you hear me say , quite clearly , that only one - tat spleen was needed ? Did n't I state plainly that a dash of leech juice would suffice ? What do I have to do to make you understand , Longbottom ? '' 
`` Help me ! '' 
`` As you 're all in my House , you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween . No form , no visiting the village , so do n't forget ! '' 
`` I wrote them down ! '' 
`` I 've lost the passwords ! '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` I 'll come with you ! '' 
`` She 's seeing us all separately , '' 
`` Have either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball ? '' 
`` She says the crystal ball 's told her that if I tell you , I 'll have a horrible accident ! '' 
`` Well , my gran brought me up and she 's a witch , '' 
`` but the family thought I was all - Muggle for ages . My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight . Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go . But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road . They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy . And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see . Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . '' 
`` It 's a Remembrall ! '' 
`` Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there 's something you 've forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh ... '' 
`` You 've forgotten something ... '' 
`` They 're in here somewhere , '' 
`` probably hiding . '' 
`` I think we 'll be okay -- get off , Neville ! '' 
`` There is n't a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n't play at all . '' 
`` Malfoy , '' 
`` Report him ! '' 
`` I do n't want more trouble , '' 
`` There 's no need to tell me I 'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy 's already done that , '' 
`` The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n't it ? And where 's Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . '' 
`` Thanks , Harry ... I think I 'll go to bed ... D'you want the card , you collect them , do n't you ? '' 
`` It 's people they feel sorry for . See , there 's Potter , who 's got no parents , then there 's the Weasleys , who 've got no money -- you should be on the team , Longbottom , you 've got no brains . '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` We ca n't go in there at night -- there 's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves , I heard . '' 
'' But Neville was clearly steeling himself to do something desperate . I wo n't let you do it , ''
