`` Good thing , too , or it 'd be even bigger and Id still be polishing it , '' 
`` It 's happening again now . There have been three attacks and no one seems to know who 's behind them . Who was it last time ? '' 
`` You wanted to see me , Professor Dippet ? '' 
`` I had to see the headmaster , sir , '' 
`` C'mon ... got ta get yeh outta here ... C'mon now ... in the box ... '' 
`` Evening , Rubeus , '' 
`` What yer doin ' down here , Tom ? '' 
`` It 's all over , '' 
`` Stand aside , '' 
`` She 's still alive , '' 
`` A memory , '' 
`` We 've got to go ! If the basilisk comes - '' 
`` It wo n't come until it is called , '' 
`` Look , give me my wand , I might need it - '' 
`` You wo n't be needing it , '' 
`` I 've waited a long time for this , Harry Potter , '' 
`` We 're going to talk now , '' 
`` Well , that 's an interesting question , '' 
`` The diary , '' 
'' he recited , watching Harry 's horrified face , ` I think I 'm losing my memory . There are rooster feathers all over my robes and 1 do n't know how they got there . Dear Tom , l ca n't remember what 1 did on the night of Halloween , but a cat was attacked and I 've got paint all down my front . Dear Tom , Percy keeps telling me I 'm pale and I 'm not myself . I think he suspects me ... There was another attack today * 310 and I do n't know where I was . Tom , what am I going to do ? I think I 'm going mad ... I think I 'm the one attacking everyone , Tom ! '' 
`` it took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting her diary , '' 
`` Well , you see , Ginny told me all about you , Harry , '' 
`` And you framed him , did n't you ? I thought you made a mistake , but - '' 
`` Well , he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after Hagrid was expelled , '' 
`` No one 's died this time , not even the cat . In a few hours the Mandrake Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all right again - '' 
`` Have n't I already told you , '' 
`` that killing Mudbloods does n't matter to me anymore ? For many months now , my new target has been - you . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` how is it that you a skinny boy with no extraordinary magical talent - managed to defeat the greatest wizard of all time ? How did you escape with nothing but a scar , while Lord Voldemort 's powers were destroyed ? '' 
`` To business , Harry , '' 
`` Twice - in your past , in my future - we have met . And twice I failed to kill you . How did you survive ? Tell me everything . The longer you talk , '' 
`` the longer you stay alive . '' 
`` She stopped you killing me . And I 've seen the real you , I saw you last year . You 're a wreck . You 're barely alive . That 's where all your power got you . You 're in hiding . You 're ugly , you 're foul - '' 
`` Now , Harry , I 'm going to teach you a little lesson . Let 's match the powers of Lord Voldemort , Heir of Salazar Slytherin , against famous Harry Potter , and the best weapons Dumbledore can give him ... '' 
`` Kill him . '' 
`` ` Professor ' ? '' 
`` Is that like ` doctor ' ? What are you here for ? Did she get you in to have a look at me ? '' 
`` I do n't believe you , '' 
`` She wants me looked at , does n't she ? Tell the truth ! '' 
`` I have told you . My name is Professor Dumbledore and I work at a school called Hogwarts . I have come to offer you a place at my school -- your new school , if you would like to come . '' 
`` I am a teacher and , if you will sit down calmly , I shall tell you about Hogwarts . Of course , if you would rather not come to the school , nobody will force you -- '' 
`` I 'd like to see them try , '' 
`` is a school for people with special abilities -- '' 
`` I 'm not mad ! '' 
`` All sorts , '' 
`` I knew I was different , '' 
`` You are a wizard . '' 
`` Prove it , '' 
`` Tell the truth . '' 
`` Then you will address me as ` Professor ' or ` sir . ' '' 
`` I 'm sorry , sir . I meant -- please , Professor , could you show me -- ? '' 
`` Yes , I suppose so , sir , '' 
`` I shall know whether it has been done . And be warned : Thieving is not tolerated at Hogwarts . '' 
`` Yes , sir , '' 
`` Where do you buy spellbooks ? '' 
`` You 're coming with me ? '' 
`` Certainly , if you -- '' 
`` I do n't need you , '' 
`` I 'm used to doing things for myself , I go round London on my own all the time . How do you get to this Diagon Alley -- sir ? '' 
`` You will be able to see it , although Muggles around you -- non-magical people , that is -- will not . Ask for Tom the barman -- easy enough to remember , as he shares your name -- '' 
`` There are a lot of Toms , '' 
`` Was my father a wizard ? He was called Tom Tom Riddle too , they 've told me . '' 
`` My mother ca n't have been magic , or she would n't have died , '' 
`` You will leave from King 's Cross Station on the first of September . There is a train ticket in there too . '' 
`` I can speak to snakes . I found out when we 've been to the country on trips -- they find me , they whisper to me . Is that normal for a wizard ? '' 
`` Stop . '' 
`` Yes , I speak it , '' 
`` Died years ago , did n't he ? '' 
`` What Muggle ? '' 
`` He come back , see , '' 
`` You 've got him , Minister ! ''
