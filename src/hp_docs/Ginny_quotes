`` Leave him alone , he did n't want all that ! '' 
`` Hermione 'll probably have all the answers when they wake her up ! Mind you , she 'll go crazy when she finds out we 've got exams in three days ' time . She has n't studied . It might be kinder to leave her where she is till they 're over . '' 
`` I 've got to tell you something , '' 
`` Is it something about the Chamber of Secrets ? Have you seen something ? Someone acting oddly ? '' 
`` If you 've finished eating , I 'll take that seat , Ginny . I 'm starving , I 've only just come off patrol duty . '' 
`` Ginny , please wake up , '' 
`` Tom Riddle 's finished . Look ! Him and the basilisk . C'mon , Ginny , let 's get out of here -- '' 
`` I 'm going to be expelled ! '' 
`` I d-didn ' t know , '' 
`` Ron and Tonks should have been back first , but they missed their Portkey , it came back without them . '' 
`` And that one , '' 
`` Mum ! '' 
`` I wo n't ! '' 
`` I ca n't go home ! '' 
`` Fine , '' 
`` Ginny , you stay in this room , you hear me ? '' 
`` They said something about a bathroom , '' 
`` not long after you left . '' 
`` Tonks , '' 
`` James , give it a rest ! '' 
`` Every day , if you want us to , '' 
`` We wrote to James three times a week last year , '' 
`` You interrupted them ? '' 
`` Do n't forget to give Neville our love ! '' 
`` They 're gentle things , there 's nothing scary about them . Anyway , you wo n't be going up to school in the carriages , you 'll be going in the boats . '' 
`` He 'll be all right , '' 
`` Why are they all sending Howlers ? '' 
`` He -- er -- just asked Fleur Delacour to go to the ball with him , '' 
`` Do n't ! '' 
`` Because -- oh shut up laughing , you two -- because they 've both just been turned down by girls they asked to the ball ! '' 
`` She 's not , '' 
`` I 'm not telling you , it 's her business , '' 
`` I ca n't , '' 
`` I 'm going with -- with Neville . He asked me when Hermione said no , and I thought ... well ... I 'm not going to be able to go otherwise , I 'm not in fourth year . '' 
`` I think I 'll go and have dinner , '' 
`` It 's her , '' 
`` Oh , that 's right , defend her , '' 
`` Mum hates her , '' 
`` Well , that 's not very long ! I know why it 's happened , of course . AN EXCESS OF PHLEGM ` 93 ` It 's all this uncertainty with Voldemort coming back , people think they might be dead tomorrow , so they 're rushing all sorts of decisions they 'd normally take time over . It was the same last time he was powerful , people eloping left , right , and center -- '' 
`` Including you and Dad , '' 
`` Whereas Bill and Fleur ... well ... what have they really got in common ? He 's a hardworking , down-to-earth sort of person , whereas she 's -- '' 
`` A cow , '' 
`` You do n't really want her around forever ? '' 
`` Well , Mum 's going to put a stop to it if she can , I bet you anything . '' 
`` Listen , no bloke in his right mind 's going to fancy Tonks when Fleur 's around . I mean , Tonks is okay-looking when she is n't doing stupid things to her hair and her nose , but -- '' 
`` She 's a damn sight nicer than Phlegm , '' 
`` And she 's more intelligent , she 's an Auror ! '' 
`` I suppose you like the way Phlegm says ` ' Arry , ' do you ? '' 
`` I 'm talking to this lot ! '' 
`` She only wants me there so she does n't have to be alone with Phlegm ! '' 
`` It 'll be Fred and George 's idea of a funny joke , making sure it ca n't come off , '' 
`` But it 's got to come off ! '' 
`` Hermione ? '' 
`` The wandmaker ? '' 
`` Best range of love potions you 'll find anywhere . '' 
`` Do they work ? '' 
`` Yes , I am , '' 
`` And last time I looked , he was definitely one boy , not five . What are those ? '' 
`` I dumped him , he was a bad loser , '' 
`` But you 're moving through boyfriends a bit fast , are n't you ? '' 
`` It 's none of your business . And I 'll thank you , '' 
`` Mum , can I have a Pygmy Puff ? '' 
`` I would n't go in the kitchen just now , '' 
`` I ca n't , Harry , I said I 'd meet Dean , '' 
`` Did I hear right ? You 've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book , Harry ? '' 
`` I just -- '' 
`` Panicked , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` This was a deserted corridor till you came butting in ! '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` A what ? '' 
`` Oh yes he does ! '' 
`` No , I will not ! '' 
`` Just because I do n't do it in public -- ! '' 
`` Harry 's snogged Cho Chang ! '' 
`` And Hermione snogged Viktor Krum , it 's only you who acts like it 's something disgusting , Ron , and that 's because you 've got about as much experience as a twelve-year-old ! '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Conditions look ideal , '' 
`` No idea , but it 's great for us , '' 
`` Looking for Ron ? '' 
`` It looks like he 's eating her face , does n't it ? '' 
`` Do n't call her that , Ron , '' 
`` I 'm really glad you 're taking her , Harry , she 's so excited . '' 
`` You were in Hogsmeade ? '' 
`` Why would Slughorn want to poison Harry ? '' 
`` So you think Slughorn 's a Death Eater ? '' 
`` Or he could be innocent , '' 
`` But you said Slughorn had been planning to give that bottle to Dumbledore for Christmas , '' 
`` Do n't push me , please , Dean , '' 
`` Nearly there , '' 
`` We 're going to the hospital wing , '' 
`` It 's Minerva McGonagall 's orders , '' 
`` Of course I 'm sure ... he 's a -- a bit of a mess , that 's all . Greyback attacked him . Madam Pomfrey says he wo n't -- wo n't look the same anymore ... '' 
`` Where is he ? Bill fought those maniacs on Dumbledore 's orders , Dumbledore owes him , he ca n't leave him in this state -- '' 
`` Ron -- Dumbledore 's dead , '' 
`` Shh ! Listen ! '' 
`` He came out of the room about an hour after we started CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE ` 618 ` keeping watch , '' 
`` Anyway , '' 
`` he must have been checking whether the coast was clear to let the Death Eaters out , because the moment he saw us he threw something into the air and it all went pitch-black -- '' 
`` -- Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder , '' 
`` We tried everything , Lumos , Incendio , '' 
`` It 's no go with the Extendable Ears , she 's gone and put an Imperturbable Charm on the kitchen door . '' 
`` Tonks told me how to find out , '' 
`` Does n't stop him being a git . The way he looks at us when he sees us ... '' 
`` Bill does n't like him either , '' 
`` It 's been awful , '' 
`` I got famous because he murdered my family but could n't kill me ! Who wants to be famous for that ? Do n't they think I 'd rather it 'd never -- '' 
`` We know , Harry , '' 
`` Crookshanks , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` There are plenty of eyewitness accounts , just because you 're so narrow-minded you need to have everything shoved under your nose before you -- '' 
`` Hem , hem , '' 
`` I 'll tell Michael , '' 
`` The fool , honestly ... '' 
`` Yeah , the D.A. 's good , '' 
`` How 're you feeling ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Remember the first time we played against each other , in the third year ? '' 
`` I 'm sure it was n't that -- '' 
`` Yes , it was , '' 
`` I was lucky , '' 
`` You 're banned as long as Umbridge is in the school , '' 
`` Angelina still wo n't let him resign , '' 
`` It 's over , '' 
`` Well , we 're not sure , but we think he knocked himself out with his own bat . '' 
`` Anyway ... a package just arrived , it 's only just got through Umbridge 's new screening process ... '' 
`` It 's Easter eggs from Mum , '' 
`` There 's one for you ... There you go ... '' 
`` Are you okay , Harry ? '' 
`` You seem really down lately , '' 
`` Who is it , then ? '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` if you really want to talk to Sirius , I expect we could think of a way to do it ... '' 
`` Come on , '' 
`` The thing about growing up with Fred and George , '' 
`` is that you sort of start thinking anything 's possible if you 've got enough nerve . '' 
`` Oh damn , '' 
`` And they left you behind ? '' 
`` first of all , ` we ' are n't doing anything if you 're including yourself in that , and second of all , Ron 's the only one with a broomstick that is n't being guarded by a security troll , so -- '' 
`` I 've got a broom ! '' 
`` Excuse me , but I care what happens to Sirius as much as you do ! '' 
`` I 'm three years older than you were when you fought You-KnowWho over the Sorcerer 's Stone , '' 
`` and it 's because of me Malfoy 's stuck back in Umbridge 's office with giant flying bogeys attacking him -- '' 
`` Yeah , but -- '' 
`` We were all in the D.A. together , '' 
`` Four , Hermione , '' 
`` But unless we can find more thestrals you 're not going to be able -- '' 
`` Oh , more of them will come , '' 
`` Because in case you had n't noticed , you and Hermione are both covered in blood , '' 
`` and we know Hagrid lures thestrals with raw meat , so that 's probably why these two turned up in the first place ... '' 
`` Come here ... '' 
`` And how 're we going to let you know something 's coming ? '' 
`` I think it was to stop us knowing which door we came in from , '' 
`` Are they fish ? '' 
`` Oh look ! '' 
`` You dawdled enough by that old arch ! '' 
`` Oh , he knows how to play , little bitty baby Potter , '' 
`` I do n't think your boss will be too pleased if you come back without it , will he ? '' 
`` Harry -- what -- ? '' 
`` Well , Flitwick 's got rid of Fred and George 's swamp , '' 
`` Oh , he just says it was a really good bit of magic , '' 
`` Not at all , '' 
`` He 's really , really miserable , actually ... '' 
`` Sulking , more like , '' 
`` Yeah , she shows signs of life if you do this , '' 
`` It looks like he and Trelawney are both going to teach , '' 
`` hello '' 
`` Like I 'd never be cheerful again ... '' 
`` What 's going on ? '' 
`` Fred ! ''
