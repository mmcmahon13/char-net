`` Where 're you hoping to go , seeing as you 're neither ? '' 
`` Never mind me , how are you ? '' 
`` Karkaroff , '' 
`` He did a deal with the Ministry of Magic , '' 
`` We know he 's a good actor , '' 
`` because he convinced the Ministry of Magic to set him free , did n't he ? Now , I 've been keeping an eye on the Daily Prophet , Harry -- '' 
`` -- and reading between the lines of that Skeeter woman 's article last month , Moody was attacked the night before he started at Hogwarts . Yes , I know she says it was another false alarm , '' 
`` Karkaroff 's trying to kill me ? But -- why ? '' 
`` I 've been hearing some very strange things , '' 
`` Listen , I knew Bertha Jorkins , '' 
`` Well , times like that bring out the best in some people and the worst in others . Crouch 's principles might 've been good in the beginning -- I would n't know . He rose quickly through the Ministry , and he started ordering very harsh measures against Voldemort 's supporters . The Aurors were given new powers -- powers to kill rather than capture , for instance . And I was n't the only one who was handed straight to the dementors without trial . Crouch fought violence with violence , and authorized the use of the Unforgivable Curses against suspects . I would say he became as ruthless and cruel as many on the Dark Side . He had his supporters , mind you -- plenty of people thought he was going about things the right way , and there were a lot of witches and wizards clamoring for him to take over as Minister of Magic . When Voldemort disappeared , it looked like only a matter of time until Crouch got the top job . But then something rather unfortunate happened ... '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` Nasty little shock for old Barty , I 'd imagine . Should have spent a bit more time at home with his family , should n't he ? Ought to have left the office early once in a while ... gotten to know his own son . '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` I saw the dementors bringing him in , watched them through the bars in my cell door . He ca n't have been more than nineteen . They took him into a cell near mine . He was screaming for his mother by nightfall . He went quiet after a few days , though ... PADFOOT RETURNS ` 529 ` they all went quiet in the end ... except when they shrieked in their sleep ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` He was n't the only one , '' 
`` Most go mad in there , and plenty stop eating in the end . They lose the will to live . You could always tell when a death was coming , because the dementors could sense it , they got excited . That boy looked pretty sickly when he arrived . Crouch being an important Ministry member , he and his wife were allowed a deathbed visit . That was the last time I saw Barty Crouch , half carrying his wife past my cell . She died herself , apparently , shortly afterward . Grief . Wasted away just like the boy . Crouch never came for his son 's body . The dementors buried him outside the fortress ; I watched them do it . '' 
`` So old Crouch lost it all , just when he thought he had it made , '' 
`` Yeah , I 've heard it 's become a bit of a mania with him , '' 
`` Yes , and that does n't make sense at all , '' 
`` I think they 've both got a point , '' 
`` Ever since I found out Snape was teaching here , I 've wondered why Dumbledore hired him . Snape 's always been fascinated by the Dark Arts , he was famous for it at school . Slimy , oily , greasy-haired kid , he was , '' 
`` Snape knew more curses when he arrived at school than half the kids in seventh year , and he was part of a gang of Slytherins who nearly all turned out to be Death Eaters . '' 
`` He showed Snape something on his arm ? '' 
`` Well , I 've no idea what that 's about ... but if Karkaroff 's genuinely worried , and he 's going to Snape for answers ... '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I would n't put it past Mad-Eye to have searched every single teacher 's office when he got to Hogwarts . He takes his Defense Against the Dark Arts seriously , Moody . I 'm not sure he trusts anyone at all , and after the things he 's seen , it 's not surprising . I 'll say this for Moody , though , he never killed if he could help it . Always brought people in alive where possible . He was tough , but he never descended to the level of the Death Eaters . Crouch , though ... he 's a different matter ... is he really ill ? If he is , why did he make the effort to drag himself up to Snape 's office ? And if he 's not ... what 's he up to ? What was he doing at the World Cup that was so important he did n't turn up in the Top Box ? What 's he been doing while he should have been judging the tournament ? '' 
`` And you might try and find out whether they 've got any leads on Bertha Jorkins while you 're at it , '' 
`` Yes , he 's quoted in the article in there , '' 
`` Blustering on about how bad Bertha 's memory is . Well , maybe she 's changed since I knew her , but the Bertha I knew was n't forgetful at all -- quite the reverse . She was a bit dim , but she had an excellent memory for gossip . It used to get her into a lot of trouble ; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut . I can see her being a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic ... maybe that 's why Bagman did n't bother to look for her for so long ... '' 
`` You 'd better get back to school , '' 
`` Now listen ... '' 
`` I do n't care ... I 'll breathe freely again when this tournament 's CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN ` 534 ` over , and that 's not until June . And do n't forget , if you 're talking about me among yourselves , call me Snuffles , okay ? '' 
`` I 'll walk to the edge of the village with you , '' 
`` see if I can scrounge another paper . '' 
`` We can leave that till morning , ca n't we , Dumbledore ? '' 
`` The wands connected ? '' 
`` The Reverse Spell effect ? '' 
`` So what happens when a wand meets its brother ? '' 
`` Diggory came back to life ? '' 
`` You THE PARTING OF THE WAYS ` 699 ` have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you tonight , Harry . You have shown bravery equal to those who died fighting Voldemort at the height of his powers . You have shouldered a grown wizard 's burden and found yourself equal to it -- and you have now given us all that we have a right to expect . You will come with me to the hospital wing . I do not want you returning to the dormitory tonight . A Sleeping Potion , and some peace ... Sirius , would you like to stay with him ? '' 
`` may I ask what -- ? '' 
`` You 'll see me very soon , Harry , '' 
`` Yeah ... of course I do . '' 
`` Hogwarts , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Sirius 's head ? '' 
`` I was starting to think you 'd go to bed before everyone else had disappeared , '' 
`` Well , I think a girl -- first year by the look of her -- might 've got a glimpse of me earlier , but do n't worry , '' 
`` You sound like Molly , '' 
`` No , it was very good , '' 
`` Well , now he 's back it 's bound to hurt more often , '' 
`` I doubt it , '' 
`` Yes , but the world is n't split into good people and Death Eaters , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` but she drafted a bit of anti-werewolf legislation two years ago that makes it almost impossible for him to get a job . '' 
`` Scared of them , I expect , '' 
`` Honestly , if you made a bit of an effort with Kreacher I 'm sure he 'd respond , after all , you are the only member of his family he 's got left , and Professor Dumbledore said -- '' 
`` So what are Umbridge 's lessons like ? '' 
`` Ah , well , that figures , '' 
`` That 's exactly what he thinks you 're doing , '' 
`` or rather , that 's exactly what he 's afraid Dumbledore 's doing -- forming his own private army , with which he will be able to take on the Ministry of Magic . '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` Dâ€™you know if there 's going to be anything about Dumbledore in CHAPTER FOURTEEN ` 304 ` the Daily Prophet tomorrow ? Only Ron 's brother Percy reckons there will be -- '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` I have n't seen anyone from the Order all weekend , they 're all busy . It 's just been Kreacher and me here ... '' 
`` Ah ... '' 
`` well , he was supposed to be back by now , no one 's sure what 's happened to him . '' 
`` But Dumbledore 's not worried , so do n't you three get yourselves in a state ; I 'm sure Hagrid 's fine . '' 
`` Listen , do n't go asking too many questions about Hagrid , '' 
`` it 'll just draw even more attention to the fact that he 's not back , and I know Dumbledore does n't want that . Hagrid 's tough , he 'll be okay . '' 
`` When 's your next Hogsmeade weekend anyway ? I was thinking , we got away with the dog disguise at the station , did n't we ? I thought I could -- '' 
`` Oh that , '' 
`` they 're always guessing where I am , they have n't really got a clue -- '' 
`` Yeah , but we think this time they have , '' 
`` Something Malfoy said on the train made us think he knew it was you , and his father was on the platform , Sirius -- you know , Lucius -- so PERCY AND PADFOOT ` 305 ` do n't come up here , whatever you do , if Malfoy recognizes you again -- '' 
`` All right , all right , I 've got the point , '' 
`` You 're less like your father than I thought , '' 
`` Look -- '' 
`` Well , I 'd better get going , I can hear Kreacher coming down the stairs , '' 
`` I 'll write to tell you a time I can make it back into the fire , then , shall I ? If you can stand to risk it ? '' 
`` How 're things ? '' 
`` -- or secret Defense Against the Dark Arts groups ? '' 
`` You want to choose your meeting places more carefully , '' 
`` That 's always packed with people -- '' 
`` -- which means you 'd have been harder to overhear , '' 
`` Mundungus , of course , '' 
`` What do you think he was doing ? '' 
`` Yeah , you are , '' 
`` and just as well , is n't it , if the first thing you 're going to do on your weekend off is organize an illegal defense group . '' 
`` He was banned from the Hog 's Head twenty years ago , '' 
`` and that barman 's got a long memory . We lost Moody 's spare Invisibility Cloak when Sturgis was arrested , so Dung 's been dressing as a witch a lot lately ... Anyway ... First of all , Ron -- I 've sworn to pass on a message from your mother . '' 
`` She says on no account whatsoever are you to take part in an illegal secret Defense Against the Dark Arts group . She says you 'll be expelled for sure and your future will be ruined . She says there will be plenty of time to learn how to defend yourself later and that you are too young to be worrying about that right now . She also '' 
`` advises Harry and Hermione not to proceed with the group , though she accepts that she has no authority EDUCATIONAL DECREE NUMBER TWENTY-FOUR ` 371 ` over either of them and simply begs them to remember that she has their best interests at heart . She would have written all this to you , but if the owl had been intercepted you 'd all have been in real trouble , and she ca n't say it for herself because she 's on duty tonight . '' 
`` Never you mind , just stuff for the Order , '' 
`` So it 's fallen to me to be the messenger and make sure you tell her I passed it all on , because I do n't think she trusts me to . '' 
`` Me ? Certainly not ! '' 
`` Of course I do ! '' 
`` Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you , Harry ! '' 
`` Well , better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue , '' 
`` So , '' 
`` how are you organizing this group ? Where are you meeting ? '' 
`` How about the Shrieking Shack ? '' 
`` Fair point , '' 
`` Oh ... '' 
`` Well , I 'll have a think and get back to -- '' 
`` Why ca n't Dumbledore teach Harry ? '' 
`` Wait a moment , '' 
`` I am in rather a hurry , Black ... unlike you , I do not have unlimited leisure time ... '' 
`` I 'll get to the point , then , '' 
`` Yes , I have , '' 
`` I 've warned you , Snivellus , '' 
`` Harry -- get -- out -- of -- it ! '' 
`` Nothing , Arthur , '' 
`` Just a friendly little chat between two old school friends ... '' 
`` I want you to take this , '' 
`` A way of letting me know if Snape 's giving you a hard time . No , do n't open it in here ! '' 
`` Let 's go , then , '' 
`` Look after yourself , Harry , '' 
`` You 'll have to kill me , '' 
`` You are on probation ! '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` Let 's go , '' 
`` Somewhere about ... here ... '' 
`` SIRIUS ! '' 
`` SIRIUS ! '' 
`` Ah ... Harry Potter ... '' 
`` Harry , I owe you an explanation , '' 
`` Sirius told me that you felt Voldemort awake inside you the very night that you had the vision of Arthur Weasley 's attack . I knew at once that my worst fears were correct : Voldemort from that point had realized he could use you . In an attempt to arm you against Voldemort 's assaults on your mind , I arranged Occlumency lessons with Professor Snape . '' 
'' Stan said . '' 
`` personalty , I wo n't let any of the children out alone until he 's back in Azkaban '' 
`` They still have n't caught him , then ? '' 
`` But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts . '' 
`` They did n't see what they thought they saw ! '' 
`` I you 're going to tell them the story , get a move on , Remus , '' 
`` Snape ? '' 
`` Professor Snape was at school with us . He fought very hard against my appointment to the Defense Against the Dark Arts job . He has been telling Dumbledore A year that I am not to be trusted . He has his reasons ... you see , Sirius here played a trick on him which nearly killed him , a trick which involved me -- '' 
`` It served him right , '' 
`` You should n't have done that , '' 
`` How did you find out where he was ? '' 
`` Fudge , '' 
`` Yes , I have , '' 
`` My friends ... my old friends ... '' 
`` He killed Lily and James and now he 's going to kill me too ... You 've got to help me , Remus ... '' 
`` How else did he get out of there ? I suppose He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named taught him a few tricks ! '' 
`` What , scared to hear your old master 's name ? '' 
`` Sirius -- it 's me ... it 's Peter ... your friend ... you would n't -- '' 
`` There 's enough filth on my robes without you touching them , '' 
`` Forgive me , Remus , '' 
`` Of course , '' 
'' Harry muttered , staring into the darkness . He had a moment 's indecision , but there was nothing they could do for Ron at the moment , and by the sound of it , Black was in trouble -- Harry set off at a run , Hermione right behind him . The yelping seemed to be coming from the ground near the edge of the lake . They pelted toward it , and Harry , running flat out , felt the cold without realizing what it must mean - The yelping stopped abruptly . As they reached the lakeshore , they saw why -- Sirius had turned back into a man . He was crouched on all fours , his hands over his head . ` Nooo , '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` He 's going to be okay . He 's still out of it , but Madam Pomfrey says 351 she 'll be able to make him better . Quick -- go -- '' 
`` If I manage to get into the Ministry , I 'll have a lot of proposals to make about Magical Law Enforcement ! ''
