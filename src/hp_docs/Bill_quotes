`` Bill got twelve , too . If we 're not careful , we 'll have another Head Boy in the family . I do n't think I could stand the shame . '' 
`` And paid for by wizards , '' 
`` Everything 's fine , '' 
`` Who is it ? '' 
`` Lupin , '' 
`` It 's a boy ! We 've named him Ted , after Dora 's father ! '' 
`` Thank you , thank you , Bill '' 
`` Mum 's right , Ginny , '' 
`` Did you get them , Dad ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Well , it did n't help us tonight , whoever conjured it . It scared the Death Eaters away the moment they saw it . They all Disapparated before we 'd got near enough to unmask any of them .

`` Did you hear ? He needs quiet ! '' 
`` I 'll go to Dad , '' 
`` Tell him what has happened . Tell him I will be in direct contact with him shortly . He will need to be discreet , however . If Fudge thinks I am interfering at the Ministry -- '' 
`` Leave it to me , '' 
`` That 's already Harry 's , idiot , ''
