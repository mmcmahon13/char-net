'' He stopped again . Thinking about Ron was painful , too . Dobby leaned toward Harry , his eyes wide as headlights . ` Dobby heard tell , '' 
`` What 's been going on ? '' 
`` He works for the Ministry , '' 
`` Oh , this does n't count , '' 
`` We 're only borrowing this . It 's Dad 's , we did n't enchant it . But doing magic in front of those Muggles you live with - '' 
`` I told you , I did n't - but it 'll take too long to explain now look , can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked me up and wo n't let me come back , and obviously I ca n't magic myself out , because the Ministry'Il think that 's the second spell I 've done in three days , so - '' 
`` Stop gibbering , '' 
`` But you ca n't magic me out either - '' 
`` We do n't need to , '' 
`` Get in , '' 
`` So - what 's the story , Harry ? '' 
`` Ginny , '' 
`` Yeah , I 've seen those things they think are gnomes , '' 
`` This is a gnome , '' 
`` This is what you have to do , '' 
`` It does n't hurt them - you 've just got to make them really dizzy so they ca n't find their way back to the gnomeholes . '' 
`` Let 's leave them to it , '' 
`` Ginny , '' 
`` The Chudley Cannons , '' 
`` Ninth in the league . '' 
`` It 's a bit small , '' 
'' Then he ripped open Hermione 's letter and read it out loud : '' 
'' she shouted at the twins ' retreating backs . Harry , Ron , and Hermione strolled off along the winding , cobbled street . The bag of gold , silver , and bronze jangling cheerfully * 57 * in Harry 's pocket was clamoring to be spent , so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams , which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley , examining the fascinating shop windows . Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Can non robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door . In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop , they met Fred , George , and Lee Jordan , who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster 's Fabulous Wet-Start , No-Heat Fireworks , and in a tiny junk shop full of bro ken wands , lopsided brass scales , and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy , deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power . ` A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers , '' 
`` Oh , it 's you , '' 
`` I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay for all those . '' 
`` All we 've got to worry about now are airplanes , '' 
`` Ca n't be much further , can it ? '' 
`` It 's probably just tired , '' 
`` I think the feast 's already started , '' 
`` Maybe he 's ill ! '' 
`` Or he might have been sacked ! '' 
`` What have you done with the car ? '' 
`` That tree did more damage to us than we - '' 
'' - so we had no choice , Professor , we could n't get on the train . '' 
`` We 'll go and get our stuff , '' 
`` Well , you 're expelling us , are n't you ? '' 
`` Not much , '' 
`` Oh , good , '' 
`` I thought we 'd had it , '' 
`` Can you believe our luck , though ? '' 
`` Fred and George must 've flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them . '' 
`` Skip the lecture , '' 
`` and tell us the new password . '' 
`` Got to get upstairs - bit tired , '' 
'' ` Night , '' 
`` Oh , yeah , and get another Howler back , '' 
'' ` It 's your own fault your wand got snapped - ' '' 
`` have you outlined all Lockhart 's lessons in little hearts ? '' 
`` You 'll pay for that one , Malfoy ! '' 
`` Better out than in , '' 
`` It was bad , '' 
`` Malfoy called her ` Mudblood , ' Hagrid - '' 
`` He didn ' ! '' 
`` But I do n't know what it means . I could tell it was really rude , of course - '' 
`` It 's about the most insulting thing he could think of , '' 
`` Mudblood 's a really foul name for someone who is Muggle-born - you know , non-magic parents . There are * 115 * some wizards - like Malfoy 's family - who think they 're better than everyone else because they 're what people call pure-blood . '' 
`` I mean , the rest of us know it does n't make any difference at all . Look at Neville Longbottom - he 's pure-blood and he can hardly stand a cauldron the right way up . '' 
`` It 's a disgusting thing to call someone , '' 
`` Dirty blood , see . Common blood . It 's ridiculous . Most wizards these days are half-blood anyway . If we had n't married Muggles we 'd 've died out . '' 
`` No thanks , '' 
`` What 're we doing , Professor ? '' 
`` And no magic , Weasley - elbow grease . '' 
`` Filch 'll have me there all night , '' 
`` Come with me , Argus , '' 
`` Why go up to that corridor ? '' 
`` We were n't hungry , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Hearing voices no one else can hear is n't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . '' 
`` A Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but has n't got any magic powers . Kind of the opposite of Muggle-born wizards , but Squibs are quite unusual . If Filch 's trying to learn magic from a Kwikspell course , I reckon he must be a Squib . It would explain a lot . Like why he hates students so much . '' 
`` Somewhere over there , '' 
`` Dunno why you care . I thought he was a bit of an idiot , '' 
`` And I ca n't find the story anywhere else - '' 
`` Hermione , let me read your composition , '' 
`` You 've had ten days to finish it - '' 
`` I only need another two inches , come on - '' 
`` I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony , '' 
`` People here 'll believe anything , '' 
`` D'you really think there 's a Chamber of Secrets ? '' 
`` That 's where Filch has been keeping guard , '' 
`` I - do n't - like - spiders , '' 
`` It 's not funny , '' 
`` If you must know , when I was three , Fred turned my - my teddy bear into a great big fiIthy spider because I broke his toy broomstick ... You would n't like them either if you 'd been holding your bear and suddenly it had too many legs and ... '' 
`` It was about here , '' 
`` Level with this door . '' 
`` Ca n't go in there , '' 
`` Peeves upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself Then , of course , I remembered that I 'm - that I 'm '' 
`` Already dead , '' 
`` Just having a look around , '' 
`` Why should n't we be here ? '' 
`` Let 's think , '' 
`` Who do we know who thinks Muggle-borns are scum ? '' 
`` Of course I am ! '' 
`` They couldve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for centuries ! '' 
`` If , in a month or so , you feel like explaining , you will let us know , wo n't you ? '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` D'you think we 've got nothing better to do in Potions than listen to Snape ? '' 
`` This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me , '' 
`` Hard to see why we 'd want the book , really , '' 
`` if we were n't going to try and make one of the potions . '' 
`` I usually save it for book-signings . '' 
`` A month ? '' 
`` But it 's the best plan we 've got , so full steam ahead , I say . '' 
`` We won , though , '' 
`` What , you reckon Slytherin 's monster can duel ? '' 
`` Could be useful , '' 
`` Would n't it be good if they finished each other off ? '' 
`` Move - come on - '' 
`` Hearing voices no one else can hear is n't a good sign , even in the wizarding world . '' 
`` At this rate , we 'll be the only ones left , '' 
`` How thick can you get ? '' 
`` Now what ? '' 
`` Urgh - essence of Millicent Bulstrode , '' 
`` D'you know if the person who opened the Chamber last time was caught ? '' 
`` Ho ! '' 
`` Medicine for my stomach , '' 
`` Well , it was n't a complete waste of time , '' 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
`` If Id sprouted whiskers , Id take a break from work , '' 
`` Now what 's up with her ? '' 
`` Are you crazy ? '' 
`` You 'd be surprised , '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in detention , '' 
`` I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` That 's a brilliant theory , Hermione , '' 
`` with just one tiny little flaw . There 's nothing written in his diary . '' 
`` I 'm telling you , there 's nothing to find in there , '' 
`` He sounds like Percy , '' 
`` There you are , '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
`` Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people ... '' 
`` How many monsters d'you think this place can hold ? '' 
`` And the attacks must 've stopped after Hagrid was kicked out . Otherwise , Tom Riddle would n't have got his award . '' 
`` Oh , yes he would , '' 
'' ` Course , '' 
`` we might get to the forest and find there 's nothing to follow . Those spiders might not 've been going there at all . I know it looked like they were moving in that sort of general direction , but ... '' 
`` Good thinking , '' 
`` Oh , no , '' 
`` Hear me ? '' 
`` Probably getting ready to pounce , '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` Harry , it 's our car ! '' 
`` It 's been here all the time ! '' 
`` And we thought it was going to attack us ! '' 
`` C'mon , let 's go and find them . '' 
`` Strangers , '' 
`` Are you okay ? '' 
`` Follow the spiders , '' 
`` That 's exactly Hagrid 's problem ! '' 
`` He was innocent . '' 
`` What if she never left the bathroom ? What if she 's still there ? '' 
`` You do n't think - not Moaning Myrtle ? '' 
`` It wo n't matter that we never asked Myrtle , then ! '' 
`` What 's up ? '' 
`` Spit it out , '' 
`` Percy ! '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` Prepare his class , '' 
`` We were - we were - '' 
`` and we thought we 'd sneak into the hospital wing , you know , and tell her the Mandrakes are nearly ready and , er , not to worry - '' 
`` That , '' 
`` was the best story you 've ever come up with . '' 
`` Wonder if she did see the attacker , though ? '' 
`` But how 's the basilisk been getting around the place ? '' 
`` Pipes ... Ron , it 's been using the plumbing . I 've been hearing that voice inside the walls ... '' 
`` The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets ! '' 
`` What 'll we do ? '' 
`` She knew something , Harry , '' 
`` That 's why she was taken . It was n't some stupid thing about Percy at all. , She 'd found out something about the Chamber of Secrets . That must be why she was - '' 
`` Harry '' 
`` D'you know what ? '' 
`` What about my sister ? '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` English , '' 
`` Me too , '' 
`` You can go first , '' 
`` Under the lake , probably , '' 
`` ow ! '' 
`` What now ? '' 
`` Ginny ! '' 
`` So Hermione 's okay ! '' 
`` Yeah , you 've got to stay , mate , '' 
`` But it was supposed to have stopped ! Your scar -- it was n't supposed to do this anymore ! You must n't let that connection open up again -- Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind ! '' 
`` Well , you ca n't do anything about the '' 
`` till you 're seventeen . You 've still got the Trace on you . And we can plan here as well as anywhere , ca n't we ? Or , '' 
`` d’you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats are ? '' 
`` I think Hermione 's been doing a bit of research , '' 
`` That means I only need to stay here four days . Then I can -- '' 
`` Five days , '' 
`` It 's one extra day , '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` And are they getting married in my bedroom ? '' 
`` I 'm doing it , I 'm doing -- ! Oh , it 's you , '' 
`` We were just talking about Mad-Eye , '' 
`` Yeah , but Bill was under attack too , '' 
`` Well , all right , if you want him to be dead , '' 
`` The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves , that 's why no one 's found him , '' 
`` Hermione , I was n't trying to upset -- '' 
`` Tergeo . '' 
`` Yeah , I know , '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` What are you doing with all those books anyway ? '' 
`` Oh , of course , '' 
`` Here he goes , '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` Shut up , '' 
`` Nah , he 's just eaten , '' 
`` Oh , all right . Harry , come here . '' 
`` Descendo , '' 
`` Yeah , it is , '' 
`` no , '' 
`` He 's me , see ? '' 
`` I 'll explain it back in my room , the smell 's getting to me , '' 
`` Once we 've left , the ghoul 's going to come and live down here in my room , '' 
`` It is ! '' 
`` We ca n't hide my whole family , it 'll look too fishy and they ca n't all leave their jobs , '' 
`` Ginny 's probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring , '' 
`` Well , guests are n't going to help Mum 's stress levels , '' 
`` This R.A.B. person , '' 
`` You know , the one who stole the real locket ? '' 
`` Well , what if he did finish it off ? '' 
`` Whichever , '' 
`` it 'd be one less for us to do ! '' 
`` And once we get hold of it , how do you destroy a Horcrux ? '' 
`` Dumbledore removed them all , but he -- he did n't destroy them . '' 
`` Get to the point ! '' 
`` Can you hear us complaining ? '' 
`` Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux , then , if he 'd already read that ? '' 
`` Is n't there any way of putting yourself back together ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Oh well , lucky we 've got such a large supply of basilisk fangs , then , '' 
`` But even if we wreck the thing it lives in , '' 
`` Why ca n't the bit of 94 CHAPTER 6 . THE GHOUL IN PAJAMAS soul in it just go and live in something else ? '' 
`` Which would be a real comfort to me , I 'm sure , '' 
`` Hang on , '' 
`` It 's like being a house-elf , '' 
`` No trouble at all . '' 
`` But she still wo n't leave us alone ! '' 
`` Okay ? '' 
`` Right then , well , that 's ... yeah . '' 
`` Nice , '' 
`` Us ? '' 
`` Why us ? '' 
`` Is there such a place ? '' 
`` You can lead the way , '' 
`` A -- all of us ? '' 
`` I 'm hoping to do some good in the world ! '' 
`` Me ? No -- not really ... It was always Harry who ... '' 
`` I ... dunno , '' 
`` I ... when I say we were n't close ... I mean , I think he liked me ... '' 
`` You 're being modest , Ron , '' 
`` That is a valuable object , '' 
`` It may even be unique . Certainly it is of Dumbledore 's ow design . Why would he have left you an item so rare ? '' 
`` Put out lights , I s ' pose , '' 
`` Oi ! '' 
`` After everyone 's gone to bed . '' 
`` Thought you did n't approve of that spell ? '' 
`` Now , show us that Deluminator . '' 
`` Still , it 's cool , '' 
`` ... why he could n't have given us a hint when he was alive ? '' 
`` Thought wrong , then , did n't he ? '' 
`` You 've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard ? '' 
`` Come off it ! '' 
`` What 's that , an illness ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom 's mother might put a bit of a damper of the wedding . I 'll get the lights . '' 
`` Xenophilius Lovegood , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words , '' 
`` but I think Fred and George taught them those . '' 
`` Luna , my love , if you should feel any burgeoning talent today -- perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaim in Mermish -- do not repress it ! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies ! '' 
`` Goblin-made , you know , and been in my family for centuries . She 's a good-looking girl , but still -- French . Well , well , find me a good seat , Ronald , I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long . '' 
`` Nightmare , Muriel is , '' 
`` She used to come for Christmas every year , then , thank God , she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at dinner . Dad always says she 'll have written them out of her will -- like they care , they 're going to end up richer than anyone in the family , rate they 're going ... Wow , '' 
`` Well , it 's obvious , is n't it , Harry ? '' 
`` I mean , they can Apparate and Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we ca n't . '' 
`` Overkill , mate , '' 
`` Death Eaters , for sure , '' 
`` D’you reckon he 's been in here and had his tongue tied by Moody 's curse ? '' 
`` Sorry , sorry ! '' 
`` But how are they supposed to have 's tolen ' magic ? '' 
`` Nevertheless , unless you can prove that you have at least one close Wizarding relative , you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must suffer the punishment . '' 
`` Thank you , Ron , but I could n't let you -- '' 
`` You wo n't have a choice , '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
`` Do n't you start on her ! '' 
`` You should n't have said that stuff to Lupin , '' 
`` No , you should n't , '' 
`` Perhaps just one more , Master Harry , for luck ? '' 
`` No , he has n't , '' 
`` What 's happened ? '' 
`` She must be upset . '' 
`` I do that every time . Oh , here she is , '' 
`` Sorry ? '' 
`` Good thinking ! '' 
`` Watched the Ministry entrance for seven house . No sign of her . Saw you dad , though , Ron . He looks fine . '' 
`` Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work , '' 
`` Oh yeah , the bloke from Magical Maintenance , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` What am I going to do ? '' 
`` M-morning , '' 
`` Yaxley 's office is raining , '' 
`` Meterolojinx Recanto ? '' 
`` D’you reckon we should move on ? '' 
`` I dunno . '' 
`` Do n't say his name ! '' 
`` Great , '' 
`` and now we 've sorted that out , can we please get some food ? '' 
`` Not if I left some money under the chicken coop ? '' 
`` It 's impossible to make good food out of nothing ! You can Summon it if you know where it is , you can transform it , you can increase the quantity if you 've already got some -- '' 
`` Well , do n't bother increasing this , it 's disgusting , '' 
`` No , it 's because you 're supposed to be the best at magic ! '' 
`` Shut up about my sister , '' 
`` It sort of floated toward me , '' 
`` right into my chest , and then -- it just went straight through . 333 It was here , '' 
`` Yeah , well , that would 've been me , '' 
'' asked Harry , turning to look Ron full in the face , desperate for the answer . ` I dunno , '' 
`` Sometimes I 've thought , when I 've been a bit hacked off , he was having a laugh or -- or he just wanted to make it more difficult . But I do n't think so , not anymore . He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator , did n't he ? He -- well , '' 
`` he must 've known I 'd run out on you . '' 
`` He must 've know you 'd always want to come back . '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` Stop that , '' 
`` There 's this one program , '' 
`` If it 's annoying you , I 'll stop ! '' 
`` Er -- what are you -- ? '' 
`` We keep trying to convince ourselves Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues -- '' 
`` The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful , '' 
`` It wo n't be like Godric 's Hollow , '' 
`` Lovegood 's on your side , Harry , The Quibbler 's been for you all along , it keeps telling everyone they 've got to help you ! '' 
`` Yea , '' 
`` that makes sense . '' 
`` I think we should vote on it , '' 
`` Outvoted , Harry , sorry , '' 
`` Yeah , they 're not far from my place , '' 
`` All 's fair in love and war , '' 
`` and this is a bit of both . Cheer up , it 's the Christmas holidays , Luna 'll be home ! '' 
`` It 's weird , being this near , but not going to visit , '' 
`` I was n't at the Burrow ! '' 
`` Bill and Fleur 's new place . Shell Cottage . Bill 's always been decent to me . He -- he was n't impressed when he heard what I 'd done , but he did n't go on about it . He knew I was really sorry . None of the rest of the family knew I was there . Bill told Mum he and Fleur were n't going home for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alonge . You know , first holiday after they were married . I do n't think Fleur minded . You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck . ''

`` Where 'd you reckon the ring is now ? '' 
`` That 's what he 's after . '' 
`` I dunno ... I mean ... bits of it sort of fit together , '' 
`` But when you look at the whole thing ... '' 
`` Three Horcruxes left , '' 
`` You never know , '' 
`` Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters , '' 
`` Potterwatch , did n't I tell you that 's what it was called ? The program I keep trying to get on the radio , the only one that tells the truth about what 's going on !

`` Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago , ''

`` Dumbledore had the Elder Wand ? '' 
`` But then , let 's go ! '' 
`` Harry ! '' 
`` The unbeatable wand , Harry ! '' 
`` I 'm not supposed to ... I 'm supposed to get the Horcruxes ... '' 
`` I shall join you in the castle shortly , '' 
`` But is he dead ? '' 
`` Look at the facts , Hermione , '' 
`` But you do n't thing you did , do you ? '' 
`` There you go ! '' 
`` What d’you mean , ' gone on ' ? '' 
`` We can give you something else , '' 
`` I 'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff , you can take your pick once we get into the vault . '' 
`` No one 's , '' 
`` He 's having a laugh . We ca n't let him have that sword . '' 
`` It 'll be one of those goblin stories , '' 
`` about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them . I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he has n't asked for one of our wands . '' 
`` Goblins are n't exactly fluffy little bunnies , though , are they ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` how 's this ? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it . There 's a fake in these , is n't there ? We switch them , and give him the fake . '' 
`` Yeah , but we could scarper before he realizes -- '' 
`` Blimey , a baby ! '' 
`` He knows and he 's going to check where the others are , and the last one , '' 
`` is at Hogwarts . I knew it . I knew it . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Did you see where in Hogwarts it is ? '' 
`` Albus Dumbledore told me what it was . Been trying to keep an eye out for you . '' 
`` The silver doe , '' 
`` Was that you too ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Yeah ... well , I 'm hungry ! '' 
`` The night that your brother died , he drank a potion that drove him out of his mind . He started screaming , pleading with someone 482 CHAPTER 28 . THE MISSING MIRROR who was n't there . 'D o n't hurt them , please ... hurt me instead . ' '' 
`` How long 's this been here ? '' 
`` Released it into the wild , '' 
`` Chamber of Secrets , '' 
`` Something to get rid of Horcruxes , '' 
`` But how did you get in there ? '' 
`` You need to speak Parseltongue ! '' 
`` It 's what you did to open the locket , '' 
`` I had to have a few goes to get it right , but , '' 
`` we got there in the end . '' 
`` So ... '' 
`` So we 're another Horcrux down , '' 
`` It was nothing , '' 
`` So what 's new with you ? '' 
`` Hang on a moment ! '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Oi ! There 's a war going on here ! '' 
`` I know , mate , '' 
`` so it 's now or never , is n't it ? '' 
`` D’you think you could just -- just hold it in until we 've got the diadem ? '' 
`` Let 's hope he steps on some of them ! '' 
`` And he never realized anyone could get in ? '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` Ca n't thank you enough , '' 
`` Let 's get out of range ! '' 
`` How -- how 're we going to get in ? '' 
`` Oh -- right -- yeah -- '' 
`` Wingardium Leviosa ! '' 
`` Harry ! HARRY ! '' 
`` He beat you ! '' 
`` Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing , does n't it ? ''

`` Parked all right , then ? '' 
`` As a matter of fact , I did Confund him , '' 
`` If you 're not in Gryffindor , we 'll disinherit you , ''

`` Excellent ! '' 
`` There you go , '' 
`` That 's him , that 's him ! '' 
`` They 're not ! '' 
`` What did he catch the Snitch for ? '' 
`` Well , she 's not , '' 
`` We lost them in the dark , '' 
`` Look , can someone just explain what that skull thing was ? '' 
`` I do n't get it , '' 
`` Yeah , I bet it was ! '' 
`` But if they were the Death Eaters , why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark ? '' 
`` No ... no , there has n't been any post at all . '' 
`` Yeah ... think I will too , '' 
`` What 's up , Harry ? '' 
`` On Saturday morning , I woke up with my scar hurting again . '' 
`` It was only a dream , '' 
`` Do n't -- say -- his -- name ! '' 
`` You did n't hear her . This time CHAPTER TEN ` 150 ` was different . I told you , she went into a trance -- a real one . And she said the Dark Lord would rise again ... greater and more terrible than ever before ... and he 'd manage it because his servant was going to go back to him ... and that night Pettigrew escaped .

`` Good thinking ! '' 
`` Come and have a game of Quidditch in the orchard , Harry , '' 
`` Bung him some Owl Treats , '' 
`` Nah , it would 've been in the Daily Prophet , '' 
`` Look , here 's the stuff Mum got for you in Diagon Alley . And she 's got some gold out of your vault for you ... and she 's washed all your socks . '' 
`` What is that supposed to be ? '' 
`` Mum , you 've given me Ginny 's new dress , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` You 've got to be kidding , '' 
`` I 'll go starkers before I put that on , '' 
`` Well , they 're okay ! '' 
`` I 'm never wearing them , '' 
`` Why is everything I own rubbish ? '' 
`` Oh hurry up , '' 
`` ' Course it is , if you 're dead , '' 
`` About time , '' 
`` Aaah , ' at 's be’er , '' 
`` Yeah , we thought Peeves seemed hacked off about something , '' 
`` Oh c 'm on , ' Er-my-knee , '' 
`` Oops -- sorry , ' Arry -- '' 
`` Treacle tart , Hermione ! '' 
`` Must be , '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` Well , at least the skrewts are small , '' 
`` Well , that wo n't matter if they turn out to cure seasickness or something , will it ? '' 
`` Er -- is this the new stand on elf rights ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` My inner eye sees past your brave face to the troubled soul within . And I regret to say that your worries are not baseless . I see difficult times ahead for you , alas ... most difficult ... I fear the thing you dread will indeed come to pass ... and perhaps sooner than you think ... '' 
`` Aaaaah , '' 
`` Can I have a look at Uranus too , Lavender ? '' 
`` Miserable old bat , '' 
`` Well , bully for Professor Vector , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` A picture of your parents outside their house -- if you can call it a house ! Your mother could do with losing a bit of weight , could n't she ? '' 
`` Do n't talk to me , '' 
`` Because I want to fix that in my memory forever , '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` you 're ruining the best moment of my life ! '' 
`` Knows what ? '' 
`` We have n't got him till Thursday ! '' 
`` You know why Snape 's in such a foul mood , do n't you ? '' 
`` Imagine if Moody turned Snape into a horned toad , '' 
`` and bounced him all around his dungeon ... '' 
`` So I 'm here to bring you up to scratch on what wizards can do to each other . I 've got one year to teach you how to deal with Dark -- '' 
`` What , are n't you staying ? '' 
`` So ... do any of you know which curses are most heavily punished by wizarding law ? '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` my dad told me about one ... Is it called the Imperius Curse , or something ? '' 
`` I could make it jump out of the window , drown itself , throw itself down one of your throats ... '' 
`` Only a Quidditch player ? '' 
`` I 'm getting his autograph if I can , '' 
`` Over here ! Come and sit over here ! '' 
`` Too late , '' 
`` Yeah , that 's right , smarm up to him , Malfoy , '' 
`` Eh ? '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` Bless you , '' 
`` I 'll take your word for it , '' 
`` Yeah , I 'll just bet they are , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` She 's a veela ! '' 
`` I 'm telling you , that 's not a normal girl ! '' 
`` Anyone put their name in yet ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` You 're kidding ! '' 
`` ' Course she is , ca n't see a beard , can you ? '' 
`` What 're we going to do today , then ? '' 
`` Okay , '' 
`` just as long as he does n't ask us to donate a few fingers to the skrewts . '' 
`` What is it with her ? '' 
`` What d’you reckon 'll happen to the ones who are n't chosen ? '' 
`` Where are they sleeping , then ? '' 
`` Oh good , hurry up , '' 
`` Well , that 's lucky , '' 
`` You wait , '' 
`` Hagrid , what 's that ? '' 
`` Maybe it 's a bit much , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Oh hello , '' 
`` Well ... no one else got across the Age Line , '' 
`` Oh right , '' 
`` It 's okay , you know , you can tell me the truth , '' 
`` Yeah , okay , '' 
`` Yeah ? '' 
`` You want to get to bed , Harry . I expect you 'll need to be up early tomorrow for a photo-call or something . '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` Malfoy got Hermione ! '' 
`` Look ! '' 
`` You 've had an owl , '' 
`` And we 've got to do our detentions tomorrow night , Snape 's dungeon , '' 
`` ... and now Hagrid 's just shown me what 's coming in the first task , and it 's dragons , Sirius , and I 'm a goner , '' 
`` Tell you what , Dobby , '' 
`` We might have to shrink it a bit to fit you , '' 
`` but it 'll go well with your tea cozy . '' 
`` You know what ? '' 
`` She seems to love him , '' 
`` I 'd still rather work for him than old Crouch , '' 
`` Yeah , well , Percy would n't want to work for anyone with a sense of humor , would he ? '' 
`` Lasso one ? '' 
`` Listen , you 're not going to have any trouble . You 're a champion . You 've just beaten a Hungarian Horntail . I bet they 'll be queuing up to go with you . '' 
`` She was quite good-looking , '' 
`` She wants a new angle , Hagrid , '' 
`` You coming to this ball thing on Christmas Day , Hagrid ? '' 
`` Evil , he is , '' 
`` Leave him alone , Hermione , he 's earned a bit of a break , '' 
`` No , he 's off delivering a letter , '' 
`` Who d’you two keep writing to , eh ? '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` Who 're you going with , then ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Oi ! Angelina ! '' 
`` piece of cake . '' 
`` We 'd better use a school owl then , George , come on ... '' 
`` Well -- you know , '' 
`` Her nose is off-center , '' 
`` Er -- yeah , that sounds about right , '' 
`` Harry -- we 've just got to grit our teeth and do it , '' 
`` I do n't know what made me do it ! '' 
`` What was I playing at ? There were people -- all around -- I 've gone mad -- everyone watching ! I was just walking past her in the entrance hall -- she was standing there talking to Diggory -- and it sort of came over me -- and I asked her ! '' 
`` You were right -- her grandmother was one . It was n't your fault , I bet you just walked past when she was turning on the old charm for Diggory and got a blast of it -- but she was wasting her time . He 's going with Cho Chang . '' 
`` This is mad , '' 
`` Yeah , I know ! '' 
`` Thanks a bunch , Ginny , '' 
`` Eloise Midgen starting to look quite pretty now , is she ? Well , I 'm sure you 'll find someone somewhere who 'll have you . '' 
`` Oh come on , '' 
`` we need partners , we 're going to look really stupid if we have n't got any , everyone else has ... '' 
`` I ca n't come with you , '' 
`` No , you 're not ! '' 
`` Just because it 's taken you three years to notice , Ron , does n't mean no one else has spotted I 'm a girl ! '' 
`` Okay , okay , we know you 're a girl , '' 
`` She 's lying , '' 
`` Who is it then ? '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` this is getting stupid . Ginny , you can go with Harry , and I 'll just -- '' 
`` What 's got into them ? '' 
`` Wait here , '' 
`` Hermione -- who are you going to the ball with ? '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` Mum and Dad wo n't be too pleased . I 've been trying to persuade them to let me shrink them for ages , but they wanted me to carry on with my braces . You know , they 're dentists , they just do n't think teeth and magic should -- look ! Pigwidgeon 's back ! '' 
`` Stupid little feathery git ! '' 
`` Clear off ! '' 
`` Here -- take it , Harry , '' 
`` Hermione , he 's got ages ! '' 
`` Ah , no , Harry , how come you did n't spot that ? '' 
`` Tell you what , Dobby -- here you go -- take these two , and you can mix them up properly . And here 's your sweater . '' 
`` Sir is very kind ! '' 
`` Dobby knew sir must be a great wizard , for he is Harry Potter 's greatest friend , but Dobby did not know that he was also as generous of spirit , as noble , as selfless -- '' 
`` They 're only socks , '' 
`` Wow , Harry -- '' 
`` What , you need three hours ? '' 
`` Animal magnetism , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Oh no ... '' 
`` Where is Hermione ? '' 
`` Viktor 's just gone to get some drinks . '' 
`` Viktor ? '' 
`` If you do n't know , '' 
`` I 'm not going to tell you . '' 
`` He 's from Durmstrang ! '' 
`` He 's competing against Harry ! Against Hogwarts ! You -- you 're -- '' 
`` The enemy ! Honestly -- who was the one who was all excited when they saw him arrive ? Who was the one who wanted his autograph ? Who 's got a model of him up in their dormitory ? '' 
`` Yeah , well -- that 's his story , '' 
`` For your information , he has n't asked me one single thing about Harry , not one -- '' 
`` You 've got a funny way of showing it , '' 
`` No it is n't ! '' 
`` Why do n't you go and find Vicky , he 'll be wondering where you are , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` No idea , '' 
`` Veil , if you see her , tell her I haff drinks , '' 
`` Let 's go for a walk , '' 
`` We 're walking , '' 
`` What 's got Karkaroff all worried ? '' 
`` Let 's go ... '' 
`` I 'll explain inside , '' 
`` c 'm on ... '' 
`` Well , they 're ... they 're ... '' 
`` ... not very nice , '' 
`` I know there is n't , but ... blimey , no wonder he keeps it quiet , '' 
`` Well ... no one who knows him will care , ' cos they 'll know he 's not dangerous , '' 
`` Yeah , but there 's still the giant squid , '' 
`` He 's not at all like you 'd think , coming from Durmstrang . He likes it much better here , he told me . '' 
`` Er -- okay , '' 
`` What did he want ? '' 
`` Maybe Percy 's poisoning him , '' 
`` Funny , goblins looking for Mr. Crouch ... They 'd normally deal with the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures . '' 
`` Worrying about poor ' ickle goblins , now , are you ? '' 
`` Uh-oh , '' 
`` She 'll be after you next , Hermione , '' 
`` I 'll show her ! Silly little girl , am I ? Oh , I 'll get her back for this . First Harry , then Hagrid ... '' 
`` You do n't want to go upsetting Rita Skeeter , '' 
`` Ar , he 's righ ' , o ' course -- yeh 're all righ ' ... I bin stupid ... my ol’ dad woulda bin ashamed o ' the way I 've bin behavin ' ... '' 
`` Never shown you a picture of my old dad , have I ? Here ... '' 
`` Snape said Moody 's searched his office as well ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Dumbledore 's not stupid . He was right to trust Hagrid and Professor Lupin , even though loads of people would n't have given them jobs , so why should n't he be right about Snape , even if Snape is a bit -- '' 
`` -- evil , '' 
`` You just do n't like Crouch because of that elf , Winky , '' 
`` What 's he want to know about the next Hogsmeade weekend for ? '' 
`` He returned last , and well outside the time limit of an hour . However , the Merchieftainess informs us that Harry Potter was first to reach the hostages , and that the delay in his return was due to his determination to return all hostages to safety , not merely his own . '' 
`` There you go , Harry ! '' 
`` But I had my wand hidden up my sleeve , '' 
`` He has n't come back to Hogsmeade ? '' 
`` I told you ! '' 
`` It 's what my mum calls them , '' 
`` Known what ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` And what did you say ? '' 
`` And what did you say ? '' 
`` And he sneaked up here to search Snape 's office ! '' 
`` Yeah , it does ! '' 
`` Look , I do n't care what you say , Dumbledore trusts Snape -- '' 
`` Oh give it a rest , Hermione , '' 
`` Snape knows Karkaroff pretty well , but he wants to keep that quiet , '' 
`` Why are Moody and Crouch so keen to get into Snape 's office then ? '' 
`` I can try , '' 
`` Wonder if Percy knows all that stuff about Crouch ? '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Poor old Snuffles , '' 
`` No chance of more of those eclairs , is there ? '' 
`` Good idea , '' 
`` Give Pig something to do . You could n't give us a bit of extra food , could you ? '' 
`` It must 've been Crouch , '' 
`` Okay ... how 's this for a theory , '' 
`` And ... remind me what he said about Voldemort ? '' 
`` But he was out of his mind , like you said , so half of it was probably just raving ... '' 
`` He was sanest when he was trying to talk about Voldemort , '' 
`` Maybe he did n't want you to get there ! '' 
`` Would n't put it past him , '' 
`` Unless Crouch was already outside the grounds , '' 
`` because it only shows up to the boundaries , does n't -- '' 
`` Shh ! '' 
`` What 're you doing here ? '' 
`` Who 're you blackmailing ? '' 
`` Do n't be stupid , I was only joking , '' 
`` Did n't sound like that , '' 
`` It 's my business if you 're blackmailing someone , '' 
`` No , I wo n't ! '' 
`` Well , stop telling people what to do then . See you later . '' 
`` If it was something that serious , they 'd tell someone . They 'd tell Dumbledore . '' 
`` Well ... '' 
`` I dunno if they would . They 're ... they 're obsessed with making money lately , I noticed it when I was hanging around with them -- when -- you know -- '' 
`` Yeah , but blackmail ... '' 
`` It 's this joke shop idea they 've got , '' 
`` Would n't they ? '' 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
`` Tell Percy ? He 'd probably do a Crouch and turn them in . '' 
`` So he did Disapparate ? '' 
`` Yeah , someone could 've -- could 've pulled him onto a broom and flown off with him , could n't they ? '' 
`` So , '' 
`` d’you reckon he 's somewhere in Hogsmeade ? '' 
`` We helped , '' 
`` Ca n't we kidnap Mrs. Norris ? '' 
`` Once you 're Stunned , you ca n't aim too well , Hermione ! '' 
`` It 's going to be boiling in Trelawney 's room , she never puts out that fire , '' 
`` You all right ? '' 
`` I 'm all right , '' 
`` Mum , shut up ! '' 
`` She said Dumbledore 's got his reasons , '' 
`` Who ? '' 
`` You two made up , have you ? '' 
`` No good sittin ' worryin ' abou ' it , '' 
`` ' Arry ! '' 
`` It 's very good already , '' 
`` Wonder how the Durmstrang students are getting back , '' 
`` You 'd better hurry up ! '' 
`` The carriages 'll be here in a minute ! '' 
`` Can I have your autograph ? '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` How did you find out ? '' 
`` You 're kidding , '' 
`` That 's never -- you 're kidding -- '' 
`` When we saw Malfoy under that tree ... '' 
`` I used Jelly-Legs . Looks as though those two should n't be mixed . He seems to have sprouted little tentacles all over his face . Well , let 's not leave them here , they do n't add much to the decor . '' 
`` Well , what , then ? '' 
`` But that was all your savings ! '' 
`` See you , Harry , '' 
`` If you do n't mind , Harry , '' 
`` Not bad , '' 
`` Do n't worry about that , Mum 's bringing you up a tray ; she reckons you look underfed , '' 
`` Come off it ! '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` I know someone who 's worse than Umbridge , '' 
`` What 's up with you ? '' 
`` Ca n't you two lay off her for five seconds ? '' 
`` We all know you ca n't get enough of her . '' 
`` They 've known each other a year , '' 
`` Well , you do , '' 
`` but if she jumps out at you unexpectedly , like then ... '' 
`` It 's pathetic , '' 
`` Yeah , that 'll work , '' 
`` She has n't been much of a laugh lately , '' 
`` Tonks and Sirius barely knew each other ! '' 
`` That 's stupid , '' 
`` Dunno , '' 
`` but if Fred and George 've left it here , it 's probably not ready for the joke shop yet , so be careful . '' 
`` That 's an understatement , '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` Sounds like the sort of mental thing Dumbledore would say , '' 
`` You kept that quiet ! '' 
`` Blimey ... private lessons with Dumbledore ! '' 
`` Although the Prophet says -- '' 
`` Do n't worry , '' 
`` Mum 'll fix that , she 's good at healing minor injuries -- '' 
`` Oh well , never mind that now ! '' 
`` Are you scared ? '' 
`` When I first heard it , I was ... but now , it seems as though I always knew I 'd have to face him in the end ... '' 
`` When we heard Dumbledore was collecting you in person , we thought he might be telling you something or showing you something to do with the prophecy , '' 
`` Ca n't be long now , it 's been a month , '' 
`` Hermione , will you shut up , you 're not the only one who 's nervous ! '' 
`` They 're definitely owls , '' 
`` Only failed Divination and History of Magic , and who cares about them ? '' 
`` Outstandings '' 
`` Knew you 'd be top at Defense Against the Dark Arts , '' 
`` Oh , come off it , '' 
`` Yep -- nine ` Outstandings ' and one ` Exceeds Expectations ' at Defense Against the Dark Arts . '' 
`` Well , we 're N.E.W.T. students now ! '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Wow , I remember when Charlie wore one of these , '' 
`` Mum , d’you honestly think Voldemort 's going to be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts ? '' 
`` No , I wan na come , I want to see Fred and George 's shop ! '' 
`` And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well ! '' 
`` Blimey ... you ca n't even make a joke round here anymore ... '' 
`` Where 's mine ? '' 
`` It 's good Dad can get us these again , '' 
`` So we 'll just have a quick look around and then back to the car . We must be close , that 's number ninety-two ... ninety-four ... '' 
`` Whoa , '' 
`` No they wo n't ! '' 
`` You 'd better put it back then , and mind you put it on the right shelves . '' 
`` Given her the slip by the looks of it , '' 
`` Come on ! '' 
`` Big surprise , '' 
`` We can ! '' 
`` Hang on -- damn -- '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` What was that about ? '' 
`` Ah well , '' 
`` Maybe he 's broken his Hand of Glory , '' 
`` You reckon ? '' 
`` Malfoy 's father 's in Azkaban . Do n't you think Malfoy 'd like revenge ? '' 
`` Your scar 's not hurting again , is it ? '' 
`` In Madam Malkin 's . She did n't touch him , but he yelled and jerked his arm away from her when she went to roll up his sleeve . It was his left arm . He 's been branded with the Dark Mark . '' 
`` Well ... '' 
`` Something that seriously scared Borgin . It was the Mark , I know it -- he was showing Borgin who he was dealing with , you saw how seriously Borgin took him ! '' 
`` I 'm not sure , Harry ... '' 
`` Yeah , I still do n't reckon Voldemort would let Malfoy join ... '' 
`` Chosen One '' 
`` Hi , Harry ! '' 
`` Wish the lunch trolley would hurry up , I 'm starving , '' 
`` The usual , '' 
`` Not like him , though , is it ? Well -- that is '' 
`` How did you do that ? '' 
`` He only followed different instructions to ours , '' 
`` Could 've been a catastrophe , could n't it ? But he took a risk and it paid off . '' 
`` Hope it goes okay , '' 
`` We 've got Quidditch tryouts this morning ! '' 
`` Speak for yourself , I have n't forgotten the skrewts , '' 
`` But trials might take all morning , the number of people who have applied . '' 
`` It 's not Quidditch that 's popular , it 's you ! You 've never been more interesting , and frankly , you 've never been more fanciable . '' 
`` And you 've been through all that persecution from the Ministry when they were trying to make out you were unstable and a liar . You can still see the marks on the back of your hand where that evil woman made you write with your own blood , but you stuck to your story anyway ... '' 
`` You can still see where those brains got hold of me in the Ministry , look , '' 
`` I 'm tall , '' 
`` He might have been put under the Imperius Curse , '' 
`` It sounds like he was trying to make out he knew more than he did , '' 
`` What ! '' 
`` Wow , scary thought , the boy Voldemort , '' 
`` Gwenog Jones ? '' 
`` Okay , Professor , we 're starting now ! '' 
`` You know , I do n't think I 'll be having any of these in my garden when I 've got my own place , '' 
`` And this is another party just for Slughorn 's favorites , is it ? '' 
`` You were going to ask me ? '' 
`` No , I would n't , '' 
`` Gotcha ! '' 
`` It was an accident , I 'm sorry , Demelza , really sorry ! '' 
`` I played like a sack of dragon dung , '' 
`` let 's get this straight once and for all . It is none of your business who I go out with or what I do with them , Ron -- '' 
`` Yeah , it is ! '' 
`` Shut your mouth ! '' 
`` I 've seen you with Phlegm , hoping she 'll kiss you on the cheek every time you see her , CHAPTER FOURTEEN ` 288 ` it 's pathetic ! If you went out and got a bit of snogging done yourself , you would n't mind so much that everyone else does it ! '' 
`` You do n't know what you 're talking about ! '' 
`` Oi , out of the way ! '' 
`` Oh ... er ... '' 
`` yes , '' 
`` Peakes , go and pack up the Bludgers . Demelza , pull yourself together , you played really well today . Ron ... '' 
`` you 're my best mate , but carry on treating the rest of them like this and I 'm going to kick you off the team . '' 
`` I resign . I 'm pathetic . '' 
`` Yeah , maybe I am ! '' 
`` I know you 'll be brilliant ! '' 
`` Anything , '' 
`` There you go , Ron . Drink up . '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Stop bossing me around , Hermione . '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Lucky , I call it , '' 
`` And Vaisey off too , he 's their best goal scorer , I did n't fancy -- hey ! '' 
`` Weasley Is Our King , '' 
`` C’mon , Ginny , Demelza ! '' 
`` What are you going to do , turn us in ? '' 
`` You saved everything because you felt lucky . You did it all yourself . '' 
`` There really was n't anything in my pumpkin juice ? '' 
`` I never said you could n't -- Ron , you thought you 'd been given it too ! '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Gerremoffme ! '' 
`` She ca n't complain , '' 
`` I never promised Hermione anything , '' 
`` You could 've taken anyone ! '' 
`` What , and get attacked by another flock of canaries ? '' 
`` So did I , it was the stupidest thing I 've ever seen . '' 
`` Yes , I 'm meeting Cormac at eight , and we 're -- '' 
`` They 've already seen him , they arrived an hour ago -- they 're in Dumbledore 's office now , but they 'll be back soon ... '' 
`` Er-my-nee , '' 
`` Bin in the forest all day ! '' 
`` Well , I 'll hear them tomorrow , then . I 'm pretty tired now ... see you ... '' 
`` I mean , I am his girlfriend ! '' 
`` serious . '' 
`` So how 's McLaggen shaping up ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Yeah ... well ... it 's not that easy , is it ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Nice of you to drop in , '' 
`` Well , yeah I do , '' 
`` Really brilliant ! When I get hold of McLaggen -- '' 
`` You do n't want to get hold of him , he 's the size of a troll , '' 
`` Personally , I think there 's a lot to be said for hexing him with that toenail thing of the Prince 's . Anyway , the rest of the team might 've dealt with him before you get out of here , they 're not happy ... '' 
`` I could hear the match commentary from here , '' 
`` Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious , '' 
`` She reckons you only just arrived on time for the match . How come ? You left here early enough . '' 
`` Wish I 'd followed him now , the match was such a fiasco ... '' 
`` Do n't be stupid , '' 
`` And do n't tell me it 's all in my head , not after what I overheard between him and Snape -- '' 
`` I never said it was all in your head , '' 
`` I dunno ... Hogsmeade ? '' 
`` Well then , I dunno , '' 
`` Nice one , '' 
`` Okay then ... I want you to tail Draco Malfoy . '' 
`` I swear they 're getting smaller , '' 
`` It must 've looked funny , '' 
`` Nice commentary last match ! '' 
`` No , I 'm serious ! '' 
`` I ca n't remember enjoying commentary more ! What is this , by the way ? '' 
`` You know , she 's grown on me , Luna , '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` At least you can Apparate , though ! '' 
`` How d’you spell ` belligerent ' ? '' 
`` Ah no ! '' 
`` I love you , Hermione , '' 
`` I wo n't , '' 
`` You have n't ever chucked anyone , have you ? '' 
`` Thanks a million , '' 
`` Maybe the Marauders never knew the room was there , '' 
`` Yeah , it 's great , '' 
`` Nicked what ? '' 
`` He 's got Crabbe and Goyle transforming into girls ? '' 
`` Wish I could Disapparate like a house-elf , '' 
`` Anyone we know -- ? '' 
`` Well , what Harry said is the most useful if we 're trying to tell them apart ! '' 
`` Snape 's right , though , is n't he ? '' 
`` Who were you expecting ? '' 
`` When you say you had lots in common , '' 
`` d’you mean he lives in an S-bend too ? '' 
`` -- not the grave , surely ? '' 
`` You 're right , '' 
`` I 'll do the practice sessions in Hogsmeade before I decide about taking the test . '' 
`` to go straight to Slughorn 's office and try and get that memory from him . '' 
`` I did it -- well , kind of ! '' 
`` Oh , she was perfect , obviously , '' 
`` Tonks ? '' 
`` Yeah , she said she 'd come to visit Dumbledore ... '' 
`` If you ask me , '' 
`` Goes back to what I said , does n't it ? '' 
`` She 's gone a bit funny . CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE ` 468 ` Lost her nerve . Women , '' 
`` Oh , good , '' 
`` He 's mental ! '' 
`` We 've risked a lot to help Hagrid out , but after all -- Aragog 's dead . If it were a question of saving him -- '' 
`` -- I 'd want to go even less , '' 
`` Lucky , '' 
`` What for ? '' 
`` Wha -- ? Yeah , of course , '' 
`` Oh , stop that , '' 
`` Cool , '' 
`` I 'm losing track of what 's happening to everyone 's relatives , to be honest , '' 
`` They sometimes kill , '' 
`` Well done ! '' 
`` Yeah , I s ' pose , '' 
`` So , Harry -- you going to use the Felix Felicis or what ? '' 
`` It 's a great feeling when you take it , '' 
`` Yeah , but I thought I had , did n't I ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` You 've got a good feeling about burying a giant spider ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Essence of Insanity ? '' 
`` I know it was Malfoy celebrating in the Room of Requirement . Here -- '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` But he was n't bitten at the full moon , '' 
`` Greyback had n't transformed , so surely Bill wo n't be a -- a real -- ? '' 
`` Dumbledore might know something that 'd work , though , '' 
`` I messed up , Harry , '' 
`` He was on his own , clutching that awful shriveled arm -- '' 
`` His Hand of Glory , '' 
`` Gibbon was down , but the rest of the Death Eaters seemed ready to fight to the death . Neville had been hurt , Bill had been savaged by Greyback ... It was all dark ... curses flying everywhere ... The Malfoy boy had vanished , he must have slipped past , up the stairs ... then more of them ran after him , but one of them blocked the stair behind them with some kind of curse ... Neville ran at it and got thrown up into the air -- '' 
`` None of us could break through , '' 
`` and that massive Death Eater was still firing off jinxes all over the place , they were bouncing off the walls and barely missing us ... '' 
`` And then Snape was there , '' 
`` We 're with you whatever happens , '' 
`` EXPECTO PATRONUM ! '' 
`` HARRY ! Ron , he 's here , Harry 's here ! We did n't hear you arrive ! Oh , how are you ? Are you all right ? Have you been furious with us ? I bet you have , I know our letters were useless -- but we could n't tell you anything , Dumbledore made us swear we would n't , oh , we 've got so much to tell you , and you 've got to tell us -- the dementors ! When we heard -- and that Ministry hearing -- it 's just outrageous , I 've looked it all up , they ca n't expel you , they just ca n't , there 's provision in the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Sorcery for the use of magic in life-threatening situations -- '' 
`` Let him breathe , Hermione , '' 
`` She 's been in a right state , '' 
`` Pecked us half to death when she brought your last letters , look at this -- '' 
`` Sorry about that , but I wanted answers , you know ... '' 
`` We wanted to give them to you , mate , '' 
`` I think he thought you were safest with the Muggles -- '' 
`` We told Dumbledore we wanted to tell you what was going on , '' 
`` I thought that too . But he did n't want you to know anything . '' 
`` Do n't be thick , '' 
`` We 're not ! '' 
`` Mum wo n't let us near the meetings , she says we 're too young -- '' 
`` WHO HAD TO GET PAST DRAGONS AND SPHINXES AND EVERY OTHER FOUL THING LAST YEAR ? WHO SAW HIM COME BACK ? WHO HAD TO ESCAPE FROM HIM ? ME ! '' 
`` Headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix , '' 
`` Quite a few people -- '' 
`` -- we 've met about twenty of them , '' 
`` but we think there are more ... '' 
`` Er , '' 
`` Fred and George have invented Extendable Ears , see , '' 
`` -- and some of them are standing guard over something , '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` So what have you two been doing , if you 're not allowed in meetings ? '' 
`` It would have taken you about thirty seconds longer to walk down the stairs , '' 
`` Anyway , Harry , you 're interfering with reception . Extendable Ears , '' 
`` You want to be careful , '' 
`` Oh hello , Harry ! '' 
`` Whatever you do , do n't mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad , '' 
`` I 've never seen Dad row with anyone like that . It 's normally Mum who shouts ... '' 
`` It was the first week back after term ended , '' 
`` That 's exactly what we wondered , '' 
`` Bet Percy loved that . '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` Mum 's been in a right state , '' 
`` He 's not stupid , he must know your mum and dad would n't risk everything without proof -- '' 
`` Yeah , well , your name got dragged into the row , '' 
`` The house-elf who lives here , '' 
`` He 's not a nutter , Ron -- '' 
`` His life 's ambition is to have his head cut off and stuck up on a plaque just like his mother , '' 
`` Well -- well , if he is a bit strange , it 's not his fault -- '' 
`` It 's the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare , and it 's not just me , Dumbledore says we should be kind to Kreacher too -- '' 
`` Yeah , yeah , '' 
`` C’mon , I 'm starving . '' 
`` Hold it ! '' 
`` Snape never eats here , '' 
`` You 're not telling me you enjoyed it ? '' 
`` Was there ? '' 
`` Well , what does that mean ? '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` What 's going on ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` That 's out of order , Seamus , '' 
`` Yeah , I do ! '' 
`` Yeah ? Well unfortunately for you , pal , I 'm also a prefect ! '' 
`` Anyone else 's parents got a problem with Harry ? '' 
`` We 'll have to talk to them , Ron . '' 
`` It 's up to us to stop this kind of thing ! '' 
`` Seamus reckons Harry 's lying about Voldemort , '' 
`` How do you remember stuff like that ? '' 
`` And Harry said it last night , '' 
`` if that means we 're supposed to get matey with the Slytherins , fat chance . '' 
`` What d’you mean , draw attention to it ? '' 
`` Look at today ! '' 
`` Look what we 've got today , '' 
`` Why 's it cheap ? '' 
`` Cheers , '' 
`` but I think I 'll take the lessons . '' 
`` Leave me out of it , '' 
`` Yeah ... you got , what was it , three O.W.L.s each ? '' 
`` You know , I 've been wondering about that , '' 
`` Oh yeah , '' 
`` Not really , '' 
`` Except ... well ... '' 
`` Well , it 'd be cool to be an Auror , '' 
`` But they 're , like , the elite , '' 
`` We 'd fail our O.W.L.s , '' 
`` We do try , '' 
`` Have you always supported them , or just since they started winning the league ? '' 
`` We 're not going to use magic ? '' 
`` Weasley , '' 
`` And she 's trying to get people to spy for her , '' 
`` Shall we do Snape 's stuff first ? '' 
`` ` The properties ... of moonstone ... and its uses ... in potionmaking ... ' '' 
`` There . '' 
`` I -- what ? '' 
`` You handled it fine by yourself , '' 
`` What in the name of Merlin are you doing ? '' 
`` You 're leaving out hats for the house-elves ? '' 
`` That 's not on , '' 
`` They should at least see what they 're picking up , '' 
`` Anyway ... '' 
`` But on the plus side , no Snape today , '' 
`` I would n't bet on it , '' 
`` What d’you reckon are the odds of Umbridge letting you off on Friday ? '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` That 's not too bad , then , eh ? '' 
`` I ca n't believe how much homework we 've got , '' 
`` I was ... I fancied a walk , '' 
`` I 'm -- I 'm hiding from Fred and George , if you must know , '' 
`` They just went past with a bunch of first years , I bet they 're testing stuff on them again , I mean , they ca n't do it in the common room now , can they , not with Hermione there . '' 
`` I -- well -- well , okay , I 'll tell you , but do n't laugh , all right ? '' 
`` I 'm not bad , '' 
`` Every evening since Tuesday ... just on my own , though , I 've been trying to bewitch Quaffles to fly at me , but it has n't been easy and I do n't know how much use it 'll be . '' 
`` It 's just a cut -- it 's nothing -- it 's -- '' 
`` The old hag ! '' 
`` Well , I reckon you should -- '' 
`` Have a butterbeer . '' 
`` Well , she said she was pleased when I told her , '' 
`` We can take off his name and put yours on instead ... '' 
`` I think with a bit of training he 'll be all right , though . He comes from a family of good Quidditch players . I 'm banking on him turning out to have a bit more talent than he showed today , to be honest . Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening , but Hooper 's a real whiner , he 's always moaning about something or other , and Vicky 's involved in all sorts of societies , she admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charm Club she 'd put Charms first . Anyway , we 're having a practice session at two o’clock tomorrow , so just make sure you 're there this time . And do me a favor and help Ron as much as you can , okay ? '' 
`` What are you looking so pleased about ? '' 
`` Oh ... yeah ... '' 
`` Listen ... you do n't fancy going out a bit earlier with me , do you ? Just to -- er -- give me some practice before training ? So I can , you know , get my eye in a bit ... '' 
`` Anything interesting ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` I 've got all the robes I want , '' 
`` Sturgis Podmore ? '' 
`` but he 's that bloke who looks like his head 's been thatched , is n't he ? He 's one of the Ord -- '' 
`` D’you reckon he was doing something for the Order ? '' 
`` It could be a frame-up ! '' 
`` No -- listen ! '' 
`` Still , this is important too , we 've got to practice if we want to stay on the Quidditch team ... '' 
`` Yeah , that 's right , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Shut up , '' 
`` Pay attention . '' 
`` Sorry ! '' 
`` Sorry ... '' 
`` Completely lousy , '' 
`` No , of course I did n't ! Look , you said it was lousy so I just -- '' 
`` I 'm going to get started on some homework , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` and it 's Io that 's got the volcanos . '' 
`` Thanks , '' 
`` Blimey , it is ! '' 
`` What 's Percy writing to me for ? '' 
`` That 's definitely Percy 's handwriting , '' 
`` Give it back , '' 
`` He is -- '' 
`` biggest '' 
`` git . '' 
`` Come on , we 've got to get this finished some time before dawn , '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` Are you serious ? Ah , Hermione , you 're a lifesaver , '' 
`` what can I -- ? '' 
`` and then copy out this conclusion that I 've written for you . '' 
`` Hermione , you are honestly the most wonderful person I 've ever met , '' 
`` and if I 'm ever rude to you again -- '' 
`` -- I 'll know you 're back to normal , '' 
`` Er -- Harry ? '' 
`` What about -- ? '' 
`` Apparently she loathes part-humans ; she campaigned to have merpeople rounded up and tagged last year too . Imagine wasting your PERCY AND PADFOOT ` 303 ` time and energy persecuting merpeople when there are little toerags like Kreacher on the loose -- '' 
`` All we do is read the stupid textbook , '' 
`` That 's the stupidest thing I 've ever heard , including all the stuff that Luna Lovegood comes out with . '' 
`` Oh , I ca n't wait to see Minerva McGonagall inspected , '' 
`` And the homework did n't go too badly either , did it ? '' 
`` Obviously , I 'd have been thrilled if I 'd gotten an O -- '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` if you want to know what grades we got , ask . '' 
`` I do n't -- I did n't mean -- well , if you want to tell me -- '' 
`` I got a P , '' 
`` Then you get P for ` Poor ' '' 
`` and D for ` Dreadful . ' '' 
`` in case the old toad comes our way . '' 
`` I did it last time , '' 
`` it 's your turn , you tell me one . '' 
`` Let 's say I dreamed I was ... drowning Snape in my cauldron . Yeah , that 'll do ... '' 
`` What night did you dream this again ? '' 
`` I know , mate , '' 
`` Excellent , '' 
`` Well , it 's a start , '' 
`` soak your hand in that , it 's a solution of strained and pickled murtlap tentacles , it should help . '' 
`` I still reckon you should complain about this , '' 
`` And how long d’you reckon it 'd take Umbridge to pass another Decree saying anyone who complains about the High Inquisitor gets sacked immediately ? '' 
`` I suggested poison , '' 
`` Well , what can we do about that ? '' 
`` Come off it , '' 
`` I did n't think there was anything in the universe more important than homework , '' 
`` It 's about preparing ourselves , like Harry said in Umbridge 's first lesson , for what 's waiting out there . It 's about making sure we really can defend ourselves . If we do n't learn anything for a whole year -- '' 
`` We ca n't do much by ourselves , '' 
`` That 's an idea . '' 
`` You , '' 
`` You know what , I 'm not sure I want someone this stupid teaching me , '' 
`` you killed the basilisk and destroyed Tom Riddle . '' 
`` Yeah , but if Fawkes had n't turned up I -- '' 
`` Third year , '' 
`` you fought off about a hundred dementors at once -- '' 
`` You know that was a fluke , if the Time-Turner had n't -- '' 
`` Last year , '' 
`` you fought off YouKnow-Who again -- '' 
`` Listen to me ! '' 
`` Just listen to me , all right ? It sounds great when you say it like that , but all that stuff was luck -- I did n't know what I was doing half the time , I did n't plan any of it , I just did whatever I could think of , and I nearly always had help -- '' 
`` You do n't know what it 's like ! You -- neither of you -- you 've never had to face him , have you ? You think it 's just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him , like you 're in class or something ? The whole time you know there 's nothing between you and dying except your own -- your own brain or guts or whatever -- like you can CHAPTER FIFTEEN ` 328 ` think straight when you know you 're about a second from being murdered , or tortured , or watching your friends die -- they 've never taught us that in their classes , what it 's like to deal with things like that -- and you two sit there acting like I 'm a clever little boy to be standing here , alive , like Diggory was stupid , like he messed up -- you just do n't get it , that could just as easily have been me , it would have been if Voldemort had n't needed me -- '' 
`` We were n't saying anything like that , mate , '' 
`` We were n't having a go at Diggory , we did n't -- you 've got the wrong end of the -- '' 
`` Erm ... ’n ight . '' 
`` Coming ? '' 
`` Ca n't forget it , can we , with that hag teaching us -- '' 
`` I meant the idea Ron and I had '' 
`` I thought it was a good idea from the start , '' 
`` Yeah ? What did Vicky say ? '' 
`` He said Harry knew how to do stuff even he did n't , and he was in the final year at Durmstrang . '' 
`` I can have a pen pal if I -- '' 
`` He did n't only want to be your pen pal , '' 
`` you know the first weekend in October 's a Hogsmeade weekend ? How would it be if we tell anyone who 's interested to meet us in the village and we can talk it over ? '' 
`` Why do we have to do it outside school ? '' 
`` Well , you ca n't blame him for wanting to get out and about , '' 
`` I do n't reckon he 'd be stupid enough to turn up , '' 
`` Er -- why was Filch sniffing you ? '' 
`` You know what ? '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Who are you ? '' 
`` Here 's an idea , '' 
`` weasel '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Minerva McGonagall might let us have hers , she did when Harry was practicing for the Triwizard ... '' 
`` That Zacharias bloke 's a wart , '' 
`` He 's WHAT ? '' 
`` Which one was Michael Corner ? '' 
`` I did n't like him , '' 
`` But , '' 
`` So that 's why she talks now ? '' 
`` What d’you mean , who 's taking anything badly ? I 'm not going to harp on about anything ... '' 
`` I reckon you 'll be okay with Gobstones , '' 
`` I do n't think we 're going to be as lucky , though , do you ? '' 
`` She ca n't , '' 
`` There were people listening in that pub . And let 's face it , we do n't know how many of the people who turned up we can trust ... Any of them could have run off and told Umbridge ... '' 
`` Zacharias Smith ! '' 
`` Let 's go and tell her , '' 
`` Me , '' 
`` I did n't realize that would happen . It 's not fair ! '' 
`` To see you -- look at this ! '' 
`` Someone must have blabbed to her ! '' 
`` You 're so naive , '' 
`` you think just because you 're all honorable and trustworthy -- '' 
`` No , they ca n't have done because I put a jinx on that piece of parchment we all signed , '' 
`` What 'll happen to them ? '' 
`` Here comes Ernie and Hannah Abbott , '' 
`` No way , '' 
`` Do n't worry , I 'll behave myself ... '' 
`` Bet Umbridge is in History of Magic , '' 
`` She has n't inspected Binns yet ... Bet you anything she 's there ... '' 
`` Where did you take her ? '' 
`` Who 's the letter from anyway ? '' 
`` if it 's a question of influence with the Ministry , I do n't think they 've got much chance ... From what my father says , they 've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years ... And as for Potter ... My father says it 's a matter of time before the Ministry has him carted off to St. Mungo 's ... apparently they 've got a special ward for people whose brains have been addled by magic ... '' 
`` What in the name of Merlin , '' 
`` Hark who 's talking , you walked out of Divination , you hate Trelawney ! '' 
`` I think she 's got the results of her inspection back . '' 
`` Consider what ? '' 
`` No real use ? '' 
`` Sirius ! '' 
`` Why was Dung hiding from us ? '' 
`` Oh yeah ? '' 
`` On duty doing what ? '' 
`` So you want me to say I 'm not going to take part in the defense group ? '' 
`` Hey , that 's an idea ! '' 
`` Well , that clears that up , '' 
`` Hermione , it was your idea in the first place ! '' 
`` I mean ... well , I think he 'd love to be forming secret defense societies right under the nose of someone from the Ministry ... I think he 's really frustrated at how little he can do where he is ... so I think he 's keen to kind of ... egg us on . '' 
`` Sirius is right , '' 
`` you do sound just like my mother . '' 
`` I ca n't see any boils , '' 
`` What happened ? '' 
`` But ... '' 
`` He -- he ca n't be near us now , can he ? '' 
`` Did you see him ? '' 
`` But ... how do you know ? '' 
`` Is this what it was about last time ? '' 
`` He was furious ... '' 
`` You could take over from Trelawney , mate , '' 
`` No , you know what you 're doing ? '' 
`` You 've got to tell someone , '' 
`` There 's no point telling him again . '' 
`` Mimbulus mimbletonia , '' 
`` These will be good when we 're practicing Stunning , '' 
`` Yeah , it was ! '' 
`` Fat chance , '' 
`` I 've become accustomed to seeing the Quidditch Cup in my study , boys , and I really do n't want to have to hand it over to Professor Snape , so use the extra time to practice , wo n't you ? '' 
`` Got your bed booked in the hospital wing , Weasley ? '' 
`` I must 've been mental to do this , '' 
`` I 'm rubbish , '' 
`` Look at that save you made with your foot the other day , even Fred and George said it was brilliant -- '' 
`` Ron 's just got to have some breakfast . '' 
`` And you , Harry -- '' 
`` -- and it 's Warrington with the Quaffle , Warrington heading for goal , he 's out of Bludger range with just the Keeper ahead -- '' 
`` -- so it 's the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper , Weasley , brother of Beaters , Fred and George , and a promising new talent on the team -- come on , Ron ! '' 
`` -- and Gryffindor back in possession and it 's Katie Bell tanking up the pitch -- '' 
`` Harry , WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? '' 
`` -- and it 's Warrington again , '' 
`` -- and Pucey 's dodged Alicia again , and he 's heading straight for goal , stop it , Ron ! '' 
`` Walking , '' 
`` Come and sit down ! '' 
`` I 'm sorry , '' 
`` For thinking I can play Quidditch , '' 
`` I 've been given a lifetime ban . So 've Fred and George . '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` It 's bad enough without you blaming yourself for everything ! '' 
`` This is the worst I 've ever felt in my life . '' 
`` Come off it , '' 
`` you 're in a right state ! '' 
`` Hagrid , you 've been attacked ! '' 
`` Would you say it was nothing if one of us turned up with a pound of mince instead of a face ? '' 
`` You 're not going to eat that , are you , Hagrid ? '' 
`` An ' I didn ' get it ter eat . '' 
`` It was kind of ... obvious , '' 
`` Never known kids like you three fer knowin ' more ’n yeh oughta , '' 
`` Where are they ? '' 
`` O’ny their deaths are always put down ter mountaineerin ' accidents , aren ' they ? '' 
`` Come on , Hagrid , tell us what you 've been up to ! '' 
`` Are they hidden ? '' 
`` A month ? '' 
`` We 're bein ' watched , Ron , '' 
`` So you could n't use magic to get there ? '' 
`` We jus ' had ter be careful , ’cause Olympe an ' me , we stick out a bit -- '' 
`` How big are they ? '' 
`` What d’you mean ? '' 
`` There was a new Gurg , Golgomath . '' 
`` You went to speak to him ? '' 
`` I dunno if you got through to him , '' 
`` Oy ! '' 
`` I am a prefect and if one more snowball hits this window -- OUCH ! '' 
`` It 's Fred and George , '' 
`` So ? '' 
`` but that 's not for lack of trying from what he said about how hard it is to get eggs ... I do n't know how many times I told him he 'd be better off following Grubbly-Plank 's plan , I honestly do n't think he listened to half of what I said . He 's in a bit of a funny mood , you know . He still wo n't say how he got all those injuries ... '' 
`` Why does n't Hagrid call again ? '' 
`` Umbridge said they 're dangerous , '' 
`` You try putting up tinsel when Peeves has got the other end and is trying to strangle you with it , '' 
`` And they 're cheeky little snotrags , you know , we definitely were n't that rude when we were in first year , '' 
`` Extra lessons with Snape ? '' 
`` Shall I jinx him ? I can still get him from here , '' 
`` So ... so , are you saying ... '' 
`` that the weapon -- the thing YouKnow-Who 's after -- is in the Ministry of Magic ? '' 
`` Of course what ? '' 
`` How come Sturgis was trying to break in when he 's on our side ? '' 
`` I know they call the people who work in there ` Unspeakables , ' '' 
`` What happened ? '' 
`` Hermione told me to come and check on you , '' 
`` There you are , Harry , '' 
`` Bode ... '' 
`` Who expects Devil 's Snare to turn up in a hospital disguised as a potted plant ? '' 
`` I saw him at the Ministry with your dad ... '' 
`` Where are you going ? '' 
`` It ... well , I do n't know whether ... but it 's worth trying ... and I 'm the only one who can ... '' 
`` I hate it when she does that , '' 
`` You 're on probation ? '' 
`` Sorry -- I mean -- you 're on probation ? '' 
`` 'S ’n o more ’n I expected , ter tell yeh the truth . Yeh migh ' not 've picked up on it , bu ' that inspection didn ' go too well , yeh know ... anyway , '' 
`` Bes ' go an rub a bit more chili powder on them salamanders or their tails 'll be hangin ' off ’em next . See yeh , Harry ... Ron ... '' 
`` Reckon they know anything new ? '' 
`` Maybe ... '' 
`` Maybe it 's not Harry 's fault he ca n't close his mind , '' 
`` He used to be a Death Eater , '' 
`` You should write a book , '' 
`` translating mad things girls do so boys can understand them . '' 
`` It was a nightmare , '' 
`` It was appalling . Angelina was nearly in tears by the end of it . '' 
`` Weasley Is Our King '' 
`` Mind you ... when he missed the fourteenth ... '' 
`` Well , I 'll save it for parties , eh ? '' 
`` What 's going on ? '' 
`` This one 's from a bloke who thinks you 're off your rocker , '' 
`` Another one who thinks you 're barking , '' 
`` but this one says you 've got her converted , and she now thinks you 're a real hero -- she 's put in a photograph too -- wow -- '' 
`` What is going on here ? '' 
`` Will you stop acting like a maniac , and I can get you out of here ! '' 
`` Has someone been attacked again ? '' 
`` What are you talking about ? '' 
`` Remove something ... He said Bode would have known he could n't have done it ... Bode was under the Imperius Curse ... I think he said Malfoy 's dad put it on him ... '' 
`` Bode was bewitched to remove something ? '' 
`` Did you say , '' 
`` Sorry ? '' 
`` I dunno ... '' 
`` there 's been a lot going on ... '' 
`` Well , there you are , '' 
`` if you follow that you should do fine . '' 
`` What 's the point ? '' 
`` Yeah , well , I do n't blame you ! '' 
`` If it had n't been for her ... '' 
`` Well , I do n't fancy Healing , '' 
`` Shall we go and have a closer look ? '' 
`` I 'm not sure I did myself justice on Cheering Charms , I just ran out of time -- did you put in the countercharm for hiccups ? I was n't sure whether I ought to , it felt like too much -- and on question twentythree -- '' 
`` Hermione , '' 
`` we 've been through this before ... We 're not going through every exam afterward , it 's bad enough doing them once . '' 
`` She 'll be fine -- remember she got a hundred and twelve percent on one of our Charms tests ? '' 
`` Good luck , '' 
`` How were the runes ? '' 
`` Ah well , '' 
`` that 's only one mistake , is n't it , you 'll still get -- '' 
`` Oh shut up , '' 
`` Such a lovely , sweet-tempered girl , '' 
`` Well , we were always going to fail that one , '' 
`` Hagrid did well , did n't he ? '' 
`` At least they did n't get to take Hagrid off to Azkaban , '' 
`` Turn over your papers , '' 
`` Er -- my -- nee -- no ! '' 
`` So , '' 
`` Couple of Stunners , a Disarming Charm , Neville brought off a really nice little Impediment Jinx , '' 
`` Hagrid 's little brother , '' 
`` Yeah , but you 're not coming , '' 
`` Look , '' 
`` you might be able to fly without a broomstick but the rest of us ca n't sprout wings whenever we -- '' 
`` There are other ways of flying than with broomsticks , '' 
`` I s ' pose we 're going to ride on the back of the Kacky Snorgle or whatever it is ? '' 
`` Is it those mad horse things ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` How 're we supposed to get on ? '' 
`` This is mad , '' 
`` Never again , '' 
`` Let 's get on with it , '' 
`` What was that about ? '' 
`` Where do we go , then , Harry ? '' 
`` What 're those things ? '' 
`` This is n't right , we need to try another door -- '' 
`` There are doors here too , '' 
`` I 'm here , mate , '' 
`` This is it , then , is n't it ? '' 
`` But what if that 's the one ? '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` What ? '' 
`` It 's -- it 's got your name on , '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` What 's your name doing down here ? '' 
`` I 'm not here , '' 
`` Why not ? '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` Where 's the exit ? '' 
`` Where 's the way out ? '' 
`` Come out , come out , little Harry ! '' 
`` Never used an Unforgivable Curse before , have you , boy ? '' 
`` Crucio ! '' 
`` Potter , you can not win against me ! '' 
`` What ? What do you mean ? '' 
`` LIAR ! '' 
`` Nothing to summon ! It smashed and nobody heard what it said , tell your boss that -- '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` He 's ` the Boy Who Lived ' again now , though , is n't he ? '' 
`` Not such a show-off maniac anymore , eh ? '' 
`` I think he left it as a monument to Fred and George , '' 
`` They sent me all these , you know , '' 
`` I s ' pose Filch is happy , is he ? '' 
`` Bet Dumbledore wishes he could 've got rid of Trelawney for good , '' 
`` Yeah , it is , '' 
`` Still , at least Voldemort never found out what was in it either -- where are you going ? '' 
`` You know , he just got back and I promised I 'd go down and see him and tell him how you two are ... '' 
`` Oh all right then , '' 
`` Finally ! '' 
`` Dad , '' 
`` Probably 'cause it 's you , is n't it ? '' 
`` Look at this , '' 
`` Brand-new wand . Fourteen inches , willow , containing one unicorn tail-hair . And we 've got all our books -- '' 
`` What are you doing Muggle Studies for ? '' 
`` You bought that monster ? '' 
`` Herinione , that thing nearly scalped me ! '' 
`` And what about Scabbers ? '' 
`` Wonder why , '' 
`` Would we get a reward if we caught him ? '' 
`` So 's Scabbers 's rat tonic , '' 
`` The sooner we get on the train , the better , '' 
`` At least I can get away from Percy at Hogwarts . Now he 's accusing me of dripping tea on his photo of Penelope Clearwater . You know , '' 
`` his girlfriend . She 's hidden her face under the frame because her nose has gone all blotchy ... '' 
`` What were you saying ? '' 
`` You wo n't , '' 
`` What about poor Scabbers , eh ? '' 
`` Did your mother die of shock ? '' 
`` I 'm not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year , '' 
`` I mean it . If he makes one more crack about my family , I 'm going to get hold of his head and -- '' 
`` We must be nearly there , '' 
`` Great , '' 
`` Are you okay ? '' 
`` No one screamed , '' 
'' I felt weird , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Shove off , Malfoy , '' 
`` Move along there , Weasley . '' 
`` Yeah , we 'll call you , '' 
`` After you , '' 
`` Where is she ? '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` That means you 're going to have ` trials and suffering ' -- sorry about that -- but there 's a thing that could be the sun ... hang on ... that means ` great happiness ' ... so you 're going to suffer but be very happy ... '' 
`` You need your Inner Eye tested , if you ask me , '' 
`` My turn ... '' 
`` There 's a blob a bit like a bowler hat , '' 
`` How is he ? '' 
`` There 's nothing wrong with your arm , '' 
`` Weasley , you heard Professor Snape ; cut up these roots . '' 
`` But , sit -- ! '' 
`` None of your business , '' 
`` Father 's not very happy about my injury -- '' 
`` Keep talking , Malfoy , and I 'll give you a real injury , '' 
'' - he 's complained to the school governors . And to the Ministry of Magic . Father 's got a lot of influence , you know . And a lasting injury like this '' 
`` Not too far from here ... '' 
`` What are you talking about , Malfoy ? '' 
`` She was right behind us , '' 
`` How did you do that ? '' 
`` Why are you carrying all these around with you ? '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` That was the best Defense Against the Dark Arts lesson we 've ever had , was n't it ? '' 
`` What would it have been for you ? '' 
`` Why would anyone bother looking after them ? '' 
`` Look at him ! '' 
`` There 's something funny about that animal ! '' 
`` That cat 's got it in for Scabbers ! '' 
`` And Scabbers was here first , and he 's ill ! '' 
`` He 's hiding at the bottom of my bed , shaking , '' 
'' - and she ca n't have been dreading it , because it 's come as a real shock -- '' 
`` Do n't mind Hermione , Lavender , '' 
`` she does n't think other people 's pets matter very much . '' 
`` Why is n't anyone going in ? '' 
`` C'mon , '' 
`` Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be , '' 
`` But I really hope Professor Lupin gets better soon ... '' 
`` D'you know what that -- '' 
`` If Snape 's teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again , I 'm skiving off , '' 
`` Special Effects '' 
`` How about these ? '' 
`` Wow ! '' 
`` you 've learned to Apparate ! '' 
'' ` Course I have n't , '' 
`` How come Fred and George never gave it to me ! '' 
`` Are you mad ? '' 
`` See ? '' 
`` He 'd have a job spotting Harry in this , '' 
`` Seen the Fizzing Whizbees , Harry ? '' 
`` And the Jelly Slugs ? And the Acid Pops ? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven -- it burnt a hole right through my tongue . I remember Mum walloping him with her broomstick . '' 
`` Reckon Fred 'd take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him they were peanuts ? '' 
`` Tell you what , '' 
`` shall we go for a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks ? '' 
`` That 's Madam Rosmerta , '' 
`` I 'll get the drinks , shall I ? '' 
`` Merry Christmas ! '' 
`` Gone ! It 's the first day of the holidays , remember ? '' 
`` There 's a weird noise , '' 
`` Think we 'd better go and get someone ? '' 
`` Got enough on his plate what with keepin ' them dementors outta the castle , an ' Sirius Black lurkin ' around -- '' 
`` Er -- shall I make a cup of tea ? '' 
`` It 's what my mum does whenever someone 's upset , '' 
`` That 's why he would n't say it was from him ! '' 
`` In case some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism . Hey , Harry '' 
`` Malfoy ! Wait till he sees you on this ! He 'll be sick as a pig ! This is an international standard broom , this is ! '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` I know who it could 've been -- Lupin ! '' 
`` Yeah , but he likes you , '' 
`` Well , he was n't in the hospital wing , '' 
`` Do n't bring him in here ! '' 
`` What 's the matter with you ? '' 
`` It 's the best broom there is , Hermione , '' 
`` So it must 've been really expensive ... '' 
`` Probably cost more than all the Slytherins ' brooms put together , '' 
`` Who cares ? '' 
`` What d'you think Harry 's going to do with it -- sweep the floor ? '' 
`` GET -- HIM -- OUT -- OF -- HERE ! '' 
`` He got a Firebolt for Christmas , '' 
`` Still looks ill , does n't he ? '' 
`` And what are you tutting at us for ? '' 
`` Yes , you were , '' 
`` If you do n't want to tell us , do n't , '' 
`` She does n't know , '' 
`` How 's she doing it ? '' 
`` Getting to all her classes ! '' 
`` You know what -- we should make up with Hermione ... She was only trying to help ... '' 
`` Yeah , all right , '' 
`` Good even , my fine young yeomen ! Come clap this loon in irons . He is trying to force entry to the chambers within ! '' 
`` Oh , shut up , '' 
`` See , Hermione ? There was n't anything wrong with it ! '' 
`` I 'll take it ! '' 
`` LOOK ! '' 
`` LOOK ! '' 
`` BLOOD ! '' 
`` First the Firebolt , now Scabbers , everything 's my fault , is n't it ! just leave me alone , Harry , I 've got a lot of work to do ! '' 
`` He bit Goyle for us once ! '' 
`` Let the scar on Goyle 's finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory . Oh , 211 come on , Ron , get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a new rat , what 's the point of moaning ? '' 
`` Great ! Can I try and shoot a few goals on it ? '' 
`` What 's the matter ? '' 
`` Lumos ! '' 
`` Get out of here ! '' 
`` See ? '' 
`` Did you see his face ? '' 
`` Put it here , Harry , '' 
`` Yes ! '' 
`` He does n't want me to join in . '' 
`` If Scabbers had n't just been eaten , he could have had some of those Fudge Flies . He used to really like them -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Perce -- Sirius Black ! '' 
`` I was just telling them all to get back to bed ! My brother Ron here had a nightmare -- '' 
`` IT WAS N'T A NIGHTMARE ! '' 
`` Ask him ! '' 
`` Ask him if he saw -- '' 
`` We know he 's not coming in through Honeyduke 's , '' 
`` What about her ? '' 
`` She 's in a righ ' state , that 's what . She 's bin comin ' down ter visit me a lot since Chris ` mas . Bin feelin ' lonely . Firs ' yeh weren ' talking to her because o ' the Firebolt , now yer not talkin ' to her because her cat -- '' 
'' -- ate Scabbers ! '' 
`` Really upset , she was , when Black nearly stabbed yeh , Ron . She 's got her heart in the right place , Hermione has , an ' you two not talkin ' to her -- '' 
`` If she 'd just get rid of that cat , I 'd speak to her again ! '' 
`` Hogsmeade , next weekend ! '' 
`` What d'you reckon ? '' 
`` Can you hear someone talking , Harry ? '' 
`` So now you 're trying to get Harry expelled ! '' 
`` So how about it ? '' 
`` See you when you get back ! '' 
`` What kept you ? '' 
`` Where are you ? '' 
`` Are you still there ? This feels weird ... '' 
`` Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it , '' 
`` Yeah , it will , '' 
`` Oh -- well -- he was old , '' 
`` There 's still the appeal ! '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` Hermione ! '' 
`` We 're due in Charms , '' 
`` She could 've done with a Cheering Charm on her too , '' 
`` You do n't think Malfoy did something to her ? '' 
`` You know what , Hermione ? '' 
`` I thought we were n't starting crystal balls until next term , '' 
`` I do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb 's infinite depths . We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious mind and external eyes '' 
`` so as to clear the Inner Eye and the superconscious . Perhaps , if we are lucky , some of you will see before the end of the class . '' 
`` Yeah , there 's a burn on this table , '' 
`` Some day Hermione 's having , eh ? '' 
`` You 've got a Firebolt ! '' 
`` Hermione ? '' 
`` Oh , yeah , I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading , '' 
`` Does that mean the appeal 's already happened ? '' 
`` Why 'd you stop me ? '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` That 's convenient , '' 
`` You know , I 'm starting to think Hermione was right about her '' 
`` she 's a right old fraud . '' 
`` Ronald Weasley , '' 
`` Rubbish , '' 
`` Good day , my dear , '' 
'' Hermione moaned . She and Harry looked at each other , then followed at a sprint ; it '' 
`` But I wo n't deny that I am a werewolf . '' 
`` Get away ftom me , werewolf ! '' 
'' Ron yelled , trying to fore the rat back into his front pocket , but Scabbers was fighting to hard ; Ron swayed and overbalanced , and Harry caught him am pushed him back down to the bed . Then , ignoring Black , Harry turned to Lupin . There were witnesses who saw Pettigrew die , '' 
`` I 'll come quietly ... '' 
`` Up to the castle ? '' 
`` You , boy -- give me Peter , please . Now . '' 
`` What are you going to do with him if I give him to you ? '' 
`` If he really is a rat , it wo n't hurt him . '' 
`` But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty percent ! '' 
`` Are you really Harry Potter ? '' 
`` Oh - well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George 's jokes , '' 
`` I bet I 'm the worst in the class . '' 
`` She always forgets I do n't like corned beef . '' 
`` Go on -- '' 
`` You do n't want this , it 's all dry , '' 
`` She has n't got much time , '' 
`` you know , with five of us . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Do n't tell me you 'd never heard of Dumbledore ! '' 
`` We 've already told him we have n't seen it , '' 
`` Er -- all right . '' 
`` Sunshine , daisies , butter mellow , Turn this stupid , fat rat yellow . '' 
`` Whatever house I 'm in , I hope she 's not in it , '' 
`` Gryffindor , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Charlie 's in Romania studying dragons , and Bill 's in Africa doing something for Gringotts , '' 
`` What 's your Quidditch team ? '' 
`` What ! '' 
`` Oh , you wait , it 's the best game in the world -- '' 
`` And my name 's Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . '' 
`` Say that again , '' 
`` What about you , Neville ? '' 
'' Great food , is n't it ? '' 
`` You do n't know that you 'll make a fool of yourself , '' 
`` Wood told me . '' 
`` Of course he has , '' 
`` Well , a second 's there to take over if you die , '' 
`` Throw it away and punch him on the nose , '' 
`` Ca n't a person eat in peace in this place ? '' 
`` I could n't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -- '' 
`` Bet you could , '' 
'' -- and you must n't go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you 'll lose Gryffindor if you 're caught , and you 're bound to be . It 's really very selfish of you . '' 
`` Good-bye , '' 
`` If he tries to curse you , you 'd better dodge it , because I ca n't remember how to block them . '' 
`` Half-past eleven , '' 
`` we 'd better go . '' 
`` You ! '' 
`` That 's your problem , '' 
`` You 've got some nerve -- '' 
`` He 's late , maybe he 's chickened out , '' 
`` What do they think they 're doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? '' 
'' She stood up , glaring at them . I hope you 're pleased with yourselves . We could all have been killed -- or worse , expelled . Now , if you do n't mind , I 'm going to bed . '' 
`` No , we do n't mind , '' 
`` Oh , no , '' 
`` Oy , pea-brain ! '' 
`` Wingardium Leviosa ! '' 
`` Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , '' 
`` Sorry , Professor . '' 
`` Hagrid ! '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` What are you talking about , Dean ? '' 
`` But this is n't soccer , Dean , '' 
`` What are you doing ? '' 
`` Leave it to me . '' 
`` Come on , Hermione , '' 
`` Neville , you can look ! '' 
`` It was Snape , '' 
`` Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n't take his eyes off you . '' 
`` Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? '' 
`` Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid 's must seem like a palace compared to what your family 's used to . '' 
`` WEASLEY ! '' 
`` I 'll get him , '' 
`` Oh yeah , you 're right , '' 
`` I think I know who that one 's from , '' 
`` My mom . I told her you did n't expect any presents and -- oh , no , '' 
`` she 's made you a Weasley sweater . '' 
`` Every year she makes us a sweater , '' 
`` and mine 's always maroon . '' 
`` I 've heard of those , '' 
`` It 's an invisibility cloak , '' 
`` There 's a note ! '' 
`` I 'd give anything for one of these , '' 
`` I hate maroon , '' 
`` You could have woken me up , '' 
`` Look at me ! '' 
`` You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , '' 
`` Do n't talk to me for a moment , '' 
`` Say you 're ill , '' 
`` Really break your leg , '' 
`` You 've got to stand up to him , Neville ! '' 
`` I 've found him ! '' 
`` Light ? '' 
`` Are we allowed to speak yet ? '' 
`` And no wonder we could n't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry , '' 
`` I know , '' 
`` I 've never seen Snape look so mean , '' 
`` Wonder how long Potter 's going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? '' 
`` You tell him , Neville . '' 
`` Longbottom , if brains were gold you 'd be poorer than Weasley , and that 's saying something . '' 
`` We won ! You won ! We won ! '' 
`` It 'll be gone by next Tuesday , '' 
`` But we 're not six hundred years old , '' 
`` I 'll never remember this , '' 
`` Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? '' 
`` Jus ' lookin ' , '' 
`` An ' what 're you lot up ter ? '' 
`` Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , '' 
`` I 'm going to see what section he was in , '' 
`` Dragons ! '' 
`` But it 's against our laws , '' 
`` Of course there are , '' 
`` Got this outta the library -- Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit -- it 's a bit outta date , o ' course , but it 's all in here . Keep the egg in the fire , 'cause their mothers breathe on I em , see , an ' when it hatches , feed it on a bucket o ' brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour . An ' see here -- how ter recognize diff ` rent eggs -- what I got there 's a Norwegian Ridgeback . They 're rare , them . '' 
`` Wonder what it 's like to have a peaceful life , '' 
`` It 's nearly out . '' 
`` He 's lost his marbles , '' 
`` You 're losing it , too , '' 
`` Brilliant ! '' 
`` It 's not just my hand , '' 
`` although that feels like it 's about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I 've told her it was a dog , but I do n't think she believes me - I should n't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that 's why he 's doing this . '' 
`` Midnight on Saturday ! '' 
`` I 'll -- I 'll fight you ! '' 
`` get away from that hole and do n't be an idiot -- '' 
`` Do n't you call me an idiot ! '' 
`` It 's okay ! '' 
`` it 's a soft landing , you can jump ! '' 
`` HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` and lucky Harry does n't lose his head in a crisis -- ` there 's no wood , ' honestly . '' 
`` Do you think they 'll attack us if we cross the room ? '' 
`` Now what ? '' 
`` But there are hundreds of them ! '' 
`` That big one -- there -- no , there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side . '' 
`` Ron , you come at it from above -- Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I 'll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! '' 
`` It 's obvious , is n't it ? '' 
`` I think , '' 
`` we 're going to have to be chessmen . '' 
`` Now , do n't be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess -- '' 
`` We 're not offended , '' 
`` I 'm going to be a knight , '' 
`` White always plays first in chess , '' 
`` Yes ... look ... '' 
`` Had to let that happen , '' 
`` Yes ... '' 
`` It 's the only way ... I 've got to be taken . '' 
`` I always said he was off his rocker , '' 
`` D'you think he meant you to do it ? '' 
`` He 's a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It 's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could ... '' 
`` Yeah , Dumbledore 's off his rocker , all right , ''
