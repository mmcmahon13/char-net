`` That sounds fascinating ... '' 
`` Go away , '' 
'' ` Course , he 's very ambitious , Percy , he 's got it all planned out ... He wants to be Minister of Magic ... '' 
`` RON ! '' 
`` That 's a girls ' bathroom ! '' 
`` Clues , you know - '' 
`` That 's what I told Ginny , '' 
`` but she still seems to think you 're going to be expelled , I 've never seen her so upset , crying her eyes out , you might think of her , all the first years are thoroughly overexcited by this business - '' 
`` You do n't care about Ginny , '' 
`` You 're just worried I 'm going to mess up your chances of being Head Boy - '' 
`` Five points from Gryffindor ! '' 
`` And I hope it teaches you a lesson ! No more detective work , or I 'll write to Mum ! '' 
`` What 's all this commotion ? '' 
`` She was just about to tell us some - ' thing important ! '' 
`` What sort of thing ? '' 
`` Sorry ? '' 
`` Yes , Tonks is with him -- at her mother 's -- '' 
`` I was a fool ! '' 
`` I 'm sorry , Dad . '' 
`` It 's been coming on for a while , '' 
`` So , you 're my sister-in-law now ? '' 
`` I think that 's them , Al , '' 
`` Mr. Crouch 's elf ? '' 
`` Well , Mr. Crouch is quite right to get rid of an elf like that ! '' 
`` Hermione , a wizard in Mr. Crouch 's position ca n't afford a house-elf who 's going to run amok with a wand ! '' 
`` That woman 's got it in for the Ministry of Magic ! '' 
`` I 'll come with you , Father , '' 
`` Mr. Crouch will need all hands on deck . And I can give him my cauldron report in person . '' 
`` It 's been an absolute uproar , '' 
`` Complaining about security at the World Cup , '' 
`` Well , Father feels he 's got to make up for his mistake at the match , does n't he ? '' 
`` Mr. Crouch has been saying it for weeks and weeks , '' 
`` I thought we were all agreed that that elf , while irresponsible , did not conjure the Mark ? '' 
`` Now look here , Hermione ! '' 
`` I 've been promoted , '' 
`` Weatherby '' 
`` Made friends with Viktor Krum , have you , Ron ? '' 
`` What do they think they 're doing , annoying senior Ministry members ? '' 
`` I hope my brothers were n't bothering you , Ludo Bagman ? '' 
`` No , they were just telling me a bit more about those fake wands of theirs . Wondering if I could advise them on the marketing . I 've promised to put them in touch with a couple of contacts of mine at Zonko 's Joke Shop ... '' 
`` How do you feel the tournament 's going , Ludo Bagman ? Our department 's quite satisfied -- the hitch with the Goblet of Fire '' 
`` Oh I 'm sure Mr. Crouch will be up and about in no time , '' 
`` but in the meantime , I 'm more than willing to take up the slack . Of course , it 's not all attending balls '' 
`` oh no , I 've had to deal with all sorts of things that have cropped up in his absence -- you heard Ali Bashir was caught smuggling a consignment of flying carpets into the country ? And then we 've been trying to persuade the Transylvanians to sign the International Ban on Dueling . I 've got a meeting with their Head of Magical Cooperation in the new year -- '' 
`` In fact , the more impressive the worse it is , I would have thought , given that the boy did it in plain view of a Muggle ! '' 
`` Hi , '' 
`` Lucius , I 'll bet anything , '' 
`` Right , well , I think we should tackle that essay for Sprout on SelfFertilizing Shrubs first , and if we 're lucky we 'll be able to start Minerva McGonagall 's Inanimatus Conjurus before lunch ... '' 
`` Ron -- you 're not covering your middle post ! '' 
`` the world 's '' 
`` Yes , do let 's hear the latest cock-and-bull story designed to pull Potter out of trouble ! Go on , then , Dumbledore , go on -- Willy Widdershins was lying , was he ? Or was it Potter 's identical twin in the Hog 's Head that day ? Or is there the usual simple explanation involving a reversal of time , a dead man coming back to life , and a couple of invisible dementors ? '' 
`` Cornelius , I do not deny -- and nor , I am sure , does Harry -- that he was in the Hog 's Head that day , nor that he was trying to recruit students to a Defense Against the Dark Arts group . I am merely pointing out that Dolores is quite wrong to suggest that such a group was , at that time , illegal . If you remember , the Ministry decree ban - THE CENTAUR AND THE SNEAK ` 615 ` ning all student societies was not put into effect until two days after Harry 's Hogsmeade meeting , so he was not breaking any rules in the Hog 's Head at all . '' 
`` Yes , sir , I think so , sir ! '' 
`` Yes , sir , I 've got it , yes ! '' 
`` Duplicate your notes , Weasley , and send a copy to the Daily Prophet at once . If we send a fast owl we should make the morning edition ! '' 
'' said Harry , trying not to laugh . I hope you 're well ? '' 
`` Absolutely spiffing . '' 
`` My Head Boy badge is gone , '' 
`` You 're not going anywhere till you 've found my badge ! '' 
`` Let me through , please , '' 
`` Somebody get Professor Dumbledore . Quick . '' 
`` Everyone into their sleeping bags ! '' 
`` There are all sorts of enchantments on it , to stop people entering by stealth . You ca n't just Apparate in here . And I 'd like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors . They 're guarding every single entrance to the grounds . They 'd have seen him fly in too . And Fitch knows all the secret passages , they 'll have them covered ... '' 
`` The lights are going out now ! '' 
`` Any sign of him , Professor ? '' 
`` mind you behave yourself . '' 
`` Now , now , Penny , no sabotage ! '' 
`` Penelope and I have got a bet on , '' 
`` Harry -- make sure you win , '' 
`` Well done , Harry ! '' 
`` Everyone back upstairs ! '' 
`` Nonsense ! '' 
`` I certainly did n't authorize this , Professor ! '' 
`` Mad ? '' 
`` What is it ? '' 
`` Peeves , '' 
`` A poltergeist . '' 
`` Peeves -- show yourself '' 
`` Go away , Peeves , or the Baron 'll hear about this , I mean it ! '' 
`` You want to watch out for Peeves , '' 
`` Caput Draconis , '' 
`` Christmas is a time for family . ''
