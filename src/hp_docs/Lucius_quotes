`` The Ministry would n't presume to trouble you , sir , surely ? '' 
`` So he 's worried , '' 
`` Well , well , well - Arthur Weasley . '' 
`` Busy time at the Ministry , I hear , '' 
`` All those raids ... I hope they 're paying you overtime ? '' 
`` Obviously not , '' 
`` Clearly , '' 
`` That remains to be seen , '' 
`` How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it ? '' 
`` Prove it , '' 
'' -RRB- What the -- ? '' 
`` What 's that ? '' 
`` Master threw it , and Dobby caught it , and Dobby -- Dobby is free . '' 
`` You shall go now , '' 
`` You shall not touch Harry Potter . You shall go now . '' 
`` But then , that 's the Weasley boy ! '' 
`` Yes , yes , it 's Granger ! '' 
`` And beside her , we think , Potter ! Potter and his friends , caught at last ! '' 
`` STOP ! '' 
`` But we can find out easily ! '' 
`` What was that ? '' 
`` What is it , Pettigrew ? '' 
`` My Lord , I was constantly on the alert , '' 
`` To me , Potter , '' 
`` Very well , then -- '' 
`` I TOLD YOU , NO ! '' 
`` Leave Nott , leave him , I say , the Dark Lord will not care for Nott 's injuries as much as losing that prophecy -- Jugson , come back here , we need to organize ! We 'll split into pairs and search , and do n't forget , be gentle with Potter until we 've got the prophecy , you can kill the others if necessary -- Bellatrix , Rodolphus , you take the left , Crabbe , Rabastan , go right -- Jugson , Dolohov , the door straight ahead -- Macnair and Avery , through here -- Rookwood , over there -- Mulciber , come with me !
