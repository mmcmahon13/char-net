`` But , sir , '' 
`` if the Chamber can only be opened by Slytherin 's true heir , no one else would be able to find it , would they ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` you just saved -- '' 
`` And all the Hufflepuffs are talking about Diggory , '' 
`` Yeah , better you than Pretty-Boy Diggory , '' 
`` Someone attacking you , Harry ? '' 
`` Nah ... presents ! '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` I 've been wondering , how do you tell the difference between an Inferius and a ghost ? Because there was something in the paper about an Inferius -- '' 
`` She did n't want me to come back to Hogwarts . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I suppose ... because of you . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` She thinks I 'm a liar and Dumbledore 's an old fool ? '' 
`` Look ... what did happen that night when ... you know , when ... with Cedric Diggory and all ? '' 
`` Do n't you have a go at my mother , '' 
`` He 's having a go at my mother ! '' 
`` You know what ? '' 
`` Out of order , am I ? '' 
`` Then you 're mad too , '' 
`` So unless you want detention , watch your mouth ! '' 
`` You do n't know my mother , she 'll weasel anything out of anyone ! '' 
`` She says it 's the Daily Prophet that 's going downhill , not Dumbledore . She 's canceled our subscription . We believe Harry , '' 
`` I just wanted to say , '' 
`` you 've got to tell -- '' 
`` I have n't got to tell anyone , '' 
`` Hey , Harry , '' 
`` Not too far from here , '' 
`` Good for you , Harry ! '' 
`` What 's going on ? '' 
`` Call this a holiday ! '' 
`` Wonder what they 'll give us next year ? '' 
`` I 'm half-and-half , '' 
`` Harry , you need your strength , '' 
`` Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? ''
