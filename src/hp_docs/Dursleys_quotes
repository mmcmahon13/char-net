`` The magic I evoked fifteen years ago means that Harry has powerful protection while he can still call this house ` home . ' However miserable he has been here , however unwelcome , however badly treated , you have at least , grudgingly , allowed him houseroom .

I ask only this : that you allow Harry to return , once more , to this house , before his seventeenth birthday , which will ensure that the protection continues until that time . ''

'' I bet it was Dumbledore , ''
