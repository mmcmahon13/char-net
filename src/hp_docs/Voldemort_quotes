`` Mine !! '' 
`` Avada -- '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` usual evil . '' 
`` Kreacher , I 'd , er , like you to have this , '' 
`` And I think , '' 
`` He knows . '' 
`` Professor , we 've got the barricade the school , he 's coming now ! '' 
`` Give me Harry Potter , '' 
`` He could be charming when he wanted ... '' 
`` -- the night he asked for a job ! '' 
`` Harry , we 're coming , just get in there ! '' 
`` ... my Lord , their resistance is crumbling -- '' 
`` -- and it is doing so without your help , '' 
`` I have a problem , Severus , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I have performed my usual magic . I am extraordinary , but this wand ... no . It has not revealed the wonders it has promised . I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago . '' 
`` No difference , '' 
`` Come , '' 
`` You see ? '' 
`` He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds , '' 
`` killed while trying to save himself -- '' 
`` And who is this ? '' 
`` Ah , yes , I remember , '' 
`` But you are a pureblood , are n't you , my brave boy ? '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` If that is your choice , Longbottom , we revert to the original plan . On your head , '' 
`` be it . '' 
`` There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School , '' 
`` There will be no more Houses . The emblem , shield , and colors of my noble ancestor , Salazar Slytherin , will suffice for everyone . Wo n't they , Neville Longbottom ? '' 
`` Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue to oppose me , '' 
`` It 's got to be like this . It 's got to be me . '' 
`` Potter does n't mean that , '' 
`` One of us ? '' 
`` Accidents ! '' 
`` I know things you do n't know , Tom Tom Riddle . I know lots of important things that you do n't . Want to hear some , before you make another big mistake ? '' 
`` If it is not love that will save you this time , '' 
`` you must believe that you have magic that I do not , or else a weapon more powerful than mine ? '' 
`` You think you know more magic than I do ? '' 
`` You mean he was weak ! '' 
`` Dumbledore is dead ! '' 
`` What childish dream is this ? '' 
`` Snape was Dumbledore 's Dumbledore 's from the moment you started hunting down my mother . And you never realized it , because of the thing you ca n't understand . You never saw Snape cast a Patronus , did you , Tom Riddle ? '' 
`` he asked you to spare her life , did n't he ? '' 
`` He desired her , that was all , '' 
`` but when she had gone , he agreed that there were other women , and of purer blood , worthier of him -- '' 
`` Of course he told you that , '' 
`` It matters not ! '' 
`` The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy . '' 
`` But what does it matter ? '' 
`` Harry ! Harry ! '' 
`` You were clutching your scar ! '' 
`` Listen to me , reliving family history ... '' 
`` why , I am growing quite sentimental ... But look , Harry ! My true family returns ... '' 
`` Master ... Master ... '' 
`` Welcome , Death Eaters , '' 
`` Thirteen years ... thirteen years since last we met . Yet you answer my call as though it were yesterday ... We are still united under the Dark Mark , then ! Or are we ? '' 
`` I smell guilt , '' 
`` And I answer myself , '' 
`` Master ! '' 
`` Master , forgive me ! Forgive us all ! '' 
`` Get up , Avery , '' 
`` Stand up . You ask for THE DEATH EATERS ` 649 ` forgiveness ? I do not forgive . I do not forget . Thirteen long years ... I want thirteen years ' repayment before I forgive you . Pettigrew here has paid some of his debt already , have you not , Pettigrew ? '' 
`` Worthless and traitorous as you are , you helped me ... and Lord Voldemort rewards his helpers ... '' 
`` May your loyalty never waver again , Pettigrew , '' 
`` Lucius , my slippery friend , '' 
`` And yet you ran from my Mark , when a faithful Death Eater sent it into the sky last summer ? '' 
`` Of course , my Lord , of course ... You are merciful , thank you ... '' 
`` The Lestranges should stand here , '' 
`` But they are entombed in Azkaban . They were faithful . They went to Azkaban rather than renounce me ... When Azkaban is THE DEATH EATERS ` 651 ` broken open , the Lestranges will be honored beyond their dreams . The dementors will join us ... they are our natural allies ... we will recall the banished giants ... I shall have all my devoted servants returned to me , and an army of creatures whom all fear ... '' 
`` And here '' 
`` we have Crabbe ... you will do better this time , will you not , Crabbe ? And you , Goyle ? '' 
`` Yes , Master ... '' 
`` We will , Master ... '' 
`` The same goes for you , Nott , '' 
`` My Lord , I prostrate myself before you , I am your most faithful -- '' 
`` That will do , '' 
`` She told me that the Triwizard Tournament would be played at Hogwarts this year . She told me that she knew of a faithful Death Eater who would be only too willing to help me , if I could only contact him . She told me many things ... but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon her were powerful , and when I had extracted all useful information from her , her mind and body were both damaged beyond repair . She had now served her purpose . I could not possess her . I disposed of her . '' 
`` Pettigrew 's body , of course , was ill adapted for possession , as all assumed him dead , and would attract far too much attention if noticed . However , he was the able-bodied servant I needed , and , poor wizard though he is , Pettigrew was able to follow the instructions I gave him , which would return me to a rudimentary , weak body of my own , a body I would be able to inhabit while awaiting the essential ingredients for true rebirth ... a spell or two of my own invention ... a little help from my dear Nagini , '' 
`` A little break , '' 
`` a little pause ... That hurt , did n't it , Harry ? You do n't want me to do that again , do you ? '' 
`` I asked you whether you want me to do that again , '' 
`` You wo n't say no ? Harry , obedience is a virtue I need to teach you before you die ... Perhaps another little dose of pain ? '' 
`` We are not playing hide-and-seek , Harry , '' 
`` Avada Kedavra ! '' 
`` Do nothing unless I command you ! '' 
`` He was a real wizard , then ? '' 
`` When the connection is broken , we will linger for only moments ... but we will give you time ... you must get to the Portkey , it will return you to Hogwarts ... do you understand , Harry ? '' 
`` at great personal risk . '' 
`` Tom Riddle came back ? '' 
`` Robbed us , mind , before she ran off ! Where 's the locket , eh , where 's Slytherin 's locket ? '' 
`` Dishonored us , she did , that little slut ! And who 're you , coming here and asking questions about all that ? It 's over , innit ... It 's over ... '' 
`` ... I 've been told to give you this . '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` it is n't that I was n't bothered or anything , I 've just had other -- other things ... '' 
`` Other things on your mind , '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` That would be welcome , '' 
`` So , Tom ... to what do I owe the pleasure ? '' 
`` They do not call me ` Tom ' anymore , '' 
`` I am surprised you have remained here so long , '' 
`` I see it still , '' 
`` I merely wondered why you -- who are so often asked for advice by the Ministry , and who have twice , I think , been offered the post of Minister -- '' 
`` Three times at the last count , actually , '' 
`` But the Ministry never attracted me as a career . Again , something we have in common , I think . '' 
`` I have returned , '' 
`` later , perhaps , than Professor Dippet expected ... but I have returned , nevertheless , to request again what he once told me I was too young to have . I have come to you to ask that you permit me to return to this castle , to teach . I think you must know that I have seen and done much since I left this place . I could show and tell your students things they can gain from no other wizard . '' 
`` Yes , I certainly do know that you have seen and done much since leaving us , '' 
`` Rumors of your doings have reached your old school , Tom . I should be sorry to believe half of them . '' 
`` Greatness inspires envy , envy engenders spite , spite spawns lies . You must know this , Dumbledore . '' 
`` Certainly , '' 
`` Of some . Of others , you remain ... forgive me ... woefully ignorant . '' 
`` The old argument , '' 
`` Well , then , what better place to start my fresh researches than here , at Hogwarts ? '' 
`` You are mistaken , '' 
`` Let us speak openly . Why have you come here tonight , surrounded by henchmen , to request a job we both know you do not want ? '' 
`` Oh , you want to come back to Hogwarts , but you do not want to teach any more than you wanted to when you were eighteen . What is it you 're after , Tom ? Why not try an open request for once ? '' 
`` And I do n't think for a moment you expected me to . Nevertheless , you came here , you asked , you must have had a purpose . '' 
`` Er ... '' 
`` Guess what it is ? I 'm actually going to be able to remember it for once -- '' 
`` He 's got other plans ... plans he can put into operation very quietly indeed ... stuff he can only get by stealth ... like a weapon . Something he did n't have last time . '' 
`` Then ... where is it ? '' 
`` So you smashed my prophecy ? '' 
`` Master , you should know -- '' 
`` Be quiet , Bella , '' 
`` But Master -- he is here -- he is below -- '' 
`` I have nothing more to say to you , Potter , '' 
`` What -- ? '' 
`` Dumbledore ! '' 
`` By which time I shall be gone , and you dead ! '' 
`` You do not seek to kill me , Dumbledore ? '' 
`` There is nothing worse than death , Dumbledore ! '' 
'' interjected Ron angrily . '' 
'' '' 
`` Pettigrew owes his life to you . You have sent Voldemort a deputy who is in your debt ... When one wizard saves another wizard 's life , it creates a certain bond between them ... and I 'm much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry Potter . ''
