`` you 'd probably have to use Dark Magic to open it - '' 
`` Just because a wizard does n't use Dark Magic does n't mean he ca n't , Miss Pennyfeather , '' 
`` My dears , it is time for us to consider the stars , ''

Swill these around the cup three times with the left hand , then turn the cup upside down on its saucer , wait for the 83 last of the tea to drain away , then give your cup to your partner to read . You will interpret the patterns using pages five and six of Unfogging the Future . I shall move among you , helping and instructing . Oh , and dear '' 
`` Oooh , no , Harry , remember your tea leaves ! '' 
`` H -- he was only a baby ! '' 
`` Are you telling me that Professor Lupin has n't even taught you the basic distinction between -- '' 
`` We told you , '' 
`` we have n't got as far as werewolves yet , we 're still on -- ''
