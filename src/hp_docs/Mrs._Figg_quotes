`` Yes , we can ! '' 
`` I had gone out to buy cat food from the corner shop at the end of Wisteria Walk , shortly after nine on the evening of the second of August , '' 
`` when I heard a disturbance down the alleyway between Magnolia Crescent and Wisteria Walk . On approaching the mouth of the alleyway I saw dementors running -- '' 
`` That 's what I meant to say , '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` What did the dementors do ? '' 
`` They went for the boys , '' 
`` One of them had fallen . The other was backing away , trying to repel the dementor . That was Harry . He tried twice and produced silver vapor . On the third attempt , he produced a Patronus , which charged down the first dementor and then , with his encouragement , chased away the second from his cousin . And that ... that was what happened , '' 
`` That was what happened , '' 
`` You may go . ''
