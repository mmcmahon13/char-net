`` had always been happy with the wand I made him -- yes and phoenix feather , thirteenand-a-half inches -- until he discovered the connection of the twin cores . Now he seeks another , more powerful wand , as the only way to conquer yours . '' 
`` The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack , '' 
`` but the idea of the Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is , I must admit ... formidable . ''

`` And I you , my dear , '' 
`` It will be an honor , '' 
`` the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality . '' 
`` Mademoiselle Delacour , could we have you first , please ? '' 
`` Hmmm ... '' 
`` Yes , ''

`` Hmm , ''

`` Yes ... hornbeam and dragon heartstring ? '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` Aaaah , yes , ''
