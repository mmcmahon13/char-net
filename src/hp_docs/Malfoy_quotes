`` Famous Harry Potter , '' 
`` Potter , you 've got yourself a girlfriend ! '' 
`` Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop , Weasley , '' 
`` Signed photos ? You 're giving out signed photos , Potter ? '' 
`` Everyone line up ! '' 
`` Good , are n't they ? '' 
`` They got in on pure talent . '' 
`` No one asked your opinion , you fiIthy little Mudblood , '' 
'' It was Draco Malfoy . He had pushed to the front of the crowd , his cold eyes alive , his usually bloodless face flushed , as he grinned at the sight of the hanging , immobile cat . C H A P T X IR N I N E THE WRTITING ON THE WALL What 's going on here ? What 's going on ? '' 
`` My cat ! My cat ! What 's happened to Mrs. Norris ? '' 
`` All right there , Scarhead ? '' 
`` Lucius , come over here . Let 's see what you make of the famous Potter . And you , Miss Granger - you can partner Miss Bulstrode . '' 
`` two '' 
`` You know I have n't , Goyle , how many times do I have to tell you ? '' 
`` And Father wo n't tell me anything about the last time the Chamber was opened either . Of course , it was fifty years ago , so it was before his time , but he knows all about it , and he says that it was all kept quiet and it 'll look suspicious if I know too much about it . But I know one thing - last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened , a Mudblood died . So I bet it 's a matter of time before one of them 's killed this time ... I hope it 's Granger , '' 
`` Oh , yeah ... whoever it was was expelled , '' 
`` Azkaban - the wizard prison , Goyle , '' 
`` Honestly , if you were any slower , you 'd be going backward . '' 
`` Father says to keep my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it . He says the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth , but not to get mixed up in it . Of course , he 's got a lot on his plate at the moment . You know the Ministry of Magic raided our manor last week ? '' 
`` Yeah ... '' 
`` I do n't know , '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Harry Potter , '' 
`` Dobby has come to rescue you . '' 
`` That 's my wand you 're holding , Potter , '' 
`` My mother , '' 
`` I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year , '' 
`` No ! '' 
`` Potter came in here to get it , '' 
`` Avada Kedavra ! '' 
`` Look who it is . '' 
`` Well , I can certainly see why we 're trying to keep them alive , '' 
`` Your dad 's in the paper , Weasley ! '' 
`` Listen to this ! FURTHER MISTAKES AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC It seems as though the Ministry of Magic 's troubles are not yet at an end , writes Rita Skeeter , Special Correspondent . Recently under fire for its poor MAD-EYE MOODY ` 203 ` crowd control at the Quidditch World Cup , and still unable to account for the disappearance of one of its witches , the Ministry was plunged into fresh embarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold Weasley , of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office . '' 
`` Imagine them not even getting his name right , Weasley . It 's almost as though he 's a complete nonentity , is n't it ? '' 
`` And there 's a picture , Weasley ! '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Ah , look , boys , it 's the champion , '' 
`` Take this thing for a walk ? '' 
`` Want one , Granger ? '' 
`` Go on , then , Potter , '' 
`` You 're joking , Weasley ! '' 
`` Hello , Professor Moody ! '' 
`` Missing your half-breed pal ? '' 
`` Very clever , Granger , '' 
`` So , '' 
`` Trying not to think about it , are we ? '' 
`` If you 're wondering what the smell is , Mother , a Mudblood just walked in , '' 
`` Do n't you dare talk to my mother like that , Potter ! '' 
`` Ouch ! '' 
`` Certainly they work , for up to twenty-four hours at a time depending on the weight of the boy in question -- '' 
`` -- and the attractiveness of the girl , '' 
`` Listen ! '' 
`` I ca n't , '' 
`` No ? '' 
`` Perhaps this will make you more confident . '' 
`` Tell anyone , '' 
`` and there will be retribution . You know Fenrir Greyback ? He 's a family friend . He 'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you 're giving the problem your full attention . '' 
`` There will be no need for -- '' 
`` I 'll decide that , '' 
`` Fishy , is n't it ? '' 
`` I discovered this boy lurking in an upstairs corridor . He claims to have been invited to your party and to have been delayed in setting out . Did you issue him with an invitation ? '' 
`` All right , I was n't invited ! '' 
`` I did know your grandfather , after all ... '' 
`` He always spoke very highly of you , sir , '' 
`` Who suspects me ? '' 
`` So put me in detention ! Report me to Dumbledore ! '' 
`` What does it matter ? '' 
`` I do n't know how much longer , all right ? '' 
`` Yeah , I 'm really going to tell you , because it 's your business , Potter , '' 
`` Where have you been ? '' 
`` And that 's Smith of Hufflepuff with the Quaffle , '' 
`` Oh , come off it , '' 
`` That was a clear instruction ... Fine ... '' 
`` What do you mean , ` something amusing ' ? '' 
`` Why did n't you stop me , then ? '' 
`` Got there at last , have you ? '' 
`` Enchanted coins , '' 
`` Yeah , I got the idea from them , '' 
`` But as for being CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN ` 590 ` about to kill me , Draco , you have had several long minutes now , we are quite alone , I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me , and still you have not acted ... '' 
`` Maybe , '' 
`` Maybe he 's been messing with stuff that 's too big for him , if you get my drift . '' 
`` It 's just playing into Malfoy 's hands to look worried , it tells him we do n't know exactly what 's going on . We 've got to ignore him , Harry . Here , hold the bowtruckle for a moment , just so I can draw its face ... '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago , you know , and it sounds as though the Ministry 's really determined to crack down on substandard teaching in this place . So even if that overgrown moron does show up again , he 'll probably be sent packing straight away . '' 
`` What 's that Weasley 's riding ? '' 
`` Some people got D 's ? Ha ! '' 
`` That was me , '' 
`` It would n't be exactly difficult to reseal the scroll by magic ... And if anyone 's watching the Floo Network ... but I do n't really see how we can warn him not to come without that being intercepted too ! '' 
`` It 's what he wants ... '' 
`` I mean , '' 
`` -- Pucey throws to Warrington , Warrington to Montague , Montague back to Pucey -- Johnson intervenes , Johnson takes the Quaffle , Johnson to Bell , this looks good -- I mean bad -- Bell 's hit by a Bludger from Goyle of Slytherin and it 's Pucey in possession again ... '' 
`` Saved Weasley 's neck , have n't you ? '' 
`` We wanted to write another couple of verses ! '' 
`` -- but you like the Weasleys , do n't you , Potter ? '' 
`` Or perhaps , '' 
`` you can remember what your mother 's house stank like , Potter , and Weasley 's pigsty reminds you of it -- '' 
`` Harry ! HARRY ! GEORGE ! NO ! '' 
`` And you 're sure they 're trained , are you ? '' 
`` So what happened to your face , then ? '' 
`` Now if yeh 've finished askin ' stupid questions , follow me ! '' 
`` An ' you too , Neville , eh ? An ' -- '' 
`` Excuse me , '' 
`` but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing ? '' 
`` Yeah , I was gon na tell yeh how come we got a herd . Yeah , so , we started off with a male an ' five females . This one , '' 
`` name o ' Tenebrus , he 's my special favorite , firs ' one born here in the forest -- '' 
`` Are you aware , '' 
`` that the Ministry of Magic has classified thestrals as ` dangerous ' ? '' 
`` Er ... yeah ... good stuff abou ' thestrals . Well , once they 're THE EYE OF THE SNAKE ` 449 ` tamed , like this lot , yeh 'll never be lost again . ` Mazin ' senses o ' direction , jus ' tell â€™em where yeh want ter go -- '' 
`` Assuming they can understand you , of course , '' 
`` Clearly , it was very important for you to talk to somebody . Was it Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore ? Or the half-breed , Hagrid ? I doubt it was Minerva Minerva McGonagall , I hear she is still too ill to talk to anyone ... '' 
`` Very well , Harry Potter ... I offered you the chance to tell me freely . You refused . I have no alternative but to force you . Draco Malfoy -- fetch Professor Snape . '' 
`` All right , dear , let 's make it just you and me ... and we 'll take Potter too , shall we ? Get up , now -- '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` Professor Umbridge , I think some of the squad should come with you to look after -- '' 
`` I am a fully qualified Ministry official , Malfoy , do you really think CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO ` 750 ` I can not manage two wandless teenagers alone ? '' 
`` All right , '' 
`` To me , '' 
`` Always , '' 
`` Oh , you do n't know Potter as I do , Bellatrix , '' 
`` It 's time you learned the difference between life and dreams , Potter , '' 
`` Hand over the prophecy and no one need get hurt , '' 
`` Do not play games with us , Potter , '' 
`` Dumbledore never told you that the reason you bear that scar was hidden in the bowels of the Department of Mysteries ? '' 
`` Can this be ? '' 
`` Why ? '' 
`` Very good , Potter , very good ... '' 
`` REDUCTO ! '' 
`` You 're going to pay , '' 
`` You think you 're such a big man , Potter , '' 
`` The dementors have left Azkaban , '' 
`` Still , at least everyone knows what scumbags they are now -- '' 
`` Well , look who it is , '' 
`` I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this summer , 64 Weasley , '' 
`` Who 's that ? '' 
`` What were you saying , Malfoy ? '' 
`` C'mon , '' 
`` You fainted , Potter ? Is Longbottorn telling the truth ? You actualy fainted ? '' 
`` Did you faint as well , Weasley ? '' 
`` Oh , no -- er -- Professor , '' 
`` I 'm takin ' yer all back up ter school , an ' don ' let me catch yeh walkin ' down ter see me after dark again . I 'm not worth that ! '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Sir , '' 
`` sir , I 'll need help cutting up these daisy roots , because of my arm -- '' 
`` Weasley , cut up Malfoy 's roots for him , '' 
`` Professor , '' 
`` Weasley 's mutilating my roots , sit . '' 
`` And , sir , I 'll need this shrivelfig skinned , '' 
`` Seen your pal Hagrid lately ? '' 
`` I 'm afraid he wo n't be a teacher much longer , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` partly , Potter . But there are other benefits too . Weasley , slice my caterpillars for me . '' 
`` What , Malfoy ? Need something else skinned ? '' 
`` Do n't you know , Potter ? '' 
`` Know what ? '' 
`` Maybe you 'd rather not risk your neck , '' 
`` Look at the state of his robes , '' 
`` The dementors send their love , Potter ! '' 
`` Got plenty of special features , has n't it ? '' 
'' ... should have an owl from Father any time now . He had to go to the hearing to tell them about my arm ... about how I could n't use it for three months ... '' 
`` What are you doing , Weasley ? '' 
`` We were just discussing your friend Hagrid , '' 
`` Look at him blubber ! '' 
`` Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic ? '' 
`` C'mon , '' 
`` Go ! Go ! Go ! '' 
`` YES ! '' 
`` Think my name 's funny , do you ? No need to ask who you are . My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair , freckles , and more children than they can afford . '' 
`` I 'd be careful if I were you , Potter , '' 
`` Oh , you 're going to fight us , are you ? '' 
`` Malfoy 's got my Remembrall , Professor . '' 
`` Just looking , '' 
`` I 'd take you on anytime on my own , '' 
`` I 'm his second , who 's yours ? '' 
`` Midnight all right ? We 'll meet you in the trophy room ; that 's always unlocked . '' 
`` I do feel so sorry , '' 
`` for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they 're not wanted at home . '' 
`` Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n't more . Move along , all of you . '' 
`` one of these days , I 'll get him -- '' 
`` I hate them both , '' 
`` Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n't see you there . '' 
`` You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? '' 
`` I 'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy , '' 
`` The forest ? '' 
`` And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? '' 
`` I want Fang , '' 
`` AAAAAAAAAARGH ! ''
