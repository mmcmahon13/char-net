`` All right , Harry ? '' 
`` Locked in the cupboard under the stairs , and I ca n't get out of this room - '' 
`` No problem , '' 
`` So - we 'll get your trunk - you grab anything you need from your room and hand it out to Ron , '' 
`` Okay , let 's go , '' 
`` She can fly behind us . She has n't had a chance to stretch her wings for ages . '' 
`` Definitely dodgy '' 
`` Draco Malfoy ? '' 
`` I 've heard Dad talking about him , '' 
`` Oh , dear , '' 
`` Morning , Mum , '' 
`` They were starving him , Mum ! '' 
`` That lot wo n't come cheap , '' 
`` Ordinary Wizarding Levels , '' 
`` Dunno how Mum and Dad are going to afford all our school stuff this year , '' 
`` Why could n't we 've come in the car , eh ? '' 
`` Close one , Harry ! '' 
`` Unbelievable flying , Harry , '' 
`` Yeah , what about my bleeding ear ? '' 
`` She was n't too bad this morning , considering , '' 
`` Excellent , I think I see a few veela cousins , '' 
`` What first , Harry ? '' 
`` What made you see sense , Perce ? '' 
`` Well , we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these , '' 
`` Yeah , we 've left it a bit late , '' 
`` Beyond cool , '' 
`` We had him this afternoon , '' 
`` Knows what it 's like to be out there doing it , '' 
`` He 's seen it all , '' 
`` One drop each , '' 
`` How did you do it without getting a beard ? Brilliant ! '' 
`` Ron , can we borrow Pigwidgeon ? '' 
`` Because we want to send a letter , you stupid great prat , '' 
`` Who 're you going with ? '' 
`` Told you , I was joking , '' 
`` Interesting effect , '' 
`` Odd , '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` We 've given up , '' 
`` Are you saying he was involved in -- '' 
`` Nah , '' 
`` So we asked for our money back , '' 
`` Tell me about it , '' 
`` Nope , '' 
`` The goblins play as dirty as him . They say you drew with Diggory , and Bagman was betting you 'd win outright . So Bagman had to run for it . He did run for it right after the third task . '' 
`` You 're mental , '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` there 's got to be a thousand Galleons in here . '' 
`` Harry -- thanks , '' 
`` Here , '' 
`` Mr. Weasley , '' 
`` Right you are , Verity , I 'm coming , '' 
`` But -- '' 
`` You gave us our start-up loan , we have n't forgotten , '' 
`` Take whatever you like , and just remember to tell people where you got it , if they ask . '' 
`` But we 're not selling them to our sister , '' 
`` not when she 's already got about five boys on the go from what we 've -- '' 
`` Whatever you 've heard from Ron is a big fat lie , '' 
`` Pygmy Puffs , '' 
`` not to tell tales about me to these two ! '' 
`` This is n't how we imagined handing over our present , '' 
`` There we were in Hogsmeade , waiting to surprise him -- '' 
`` ... and then I got the bezoar down his throat and his breathing eased up a bit , Slughorn ran for help , Minerva McGonagall and Madam Pomfrey turned up , and they brought Ron up here . They reckon he 'll be all right . Madam Pomfrey says he 'll have to stay here a week or so ... keep taking essence of rue ... '' 
`` Blimey , it was lucky you thought of a bezoar , '' 
`` He could be under the Imperius Curse , '' 
`` Hagrid makes six , '' 
`` Firs ' Katie , now Ron ... '' 
`` I ca n't see anyone trying to bump off a Quidditch team , '' 
`` Hello , Harry , '' 
`` How d’you know ? '' 
`` Yeah , '' 
`` Remember old Fleur Delacour ? '' 
`` Charlie 's in the Order too , '' 
`` but he 's still in Romania , Dumbledore wants as many foreign wizards brought in as possible , so Charlie 's trying to make contacts on his days off . '' 
`` I think we 're well shut of him , '' 
`` Yeah , we were all surprised , '' 
`` because Percy got into a load of trouble about Crouch , there was an inquiry and everything . They said Percy ought to have realized Crouch was off his rocker and informed a superior . But you know Percy , Crouch left him in charge , he was n't going to complain ... '' 
`` Well , apparently Fudge has been storming round the Ministry checking that nobody 's having any contact with Dumbledore , '' 
`` Dad says Fudge has made it clear that anyone who 's in league with Dumbledore can clear out their desks , '' 
`` Because you 'll keep bleeding till you shrivel up , we have n't got an antidote yet , '' 
`` you ca n't advertise for testers on the Gryffindor notice board . '' 
`` Says who ? '' 
`` Fifth year 's O.W.L. year , '' 
`` Half our year had minor breakdowns coming up to O.W.L.s , '' 
`` That 's ’cause you put Bulbadox Powder in his pajamas , '' 
`` Anyway , it 's a nightmare of a year , the fifth , '' 
`` We seriously debated whether we were going to bother coming back for our seventh year , '' 
`` now that we 've got -- '' 
`` -- now that we 've got our O.W.L.s , '' 
`` Yeah , you 're right , '' 
`` this dosage looks strong enough , does n't it ? '' 
`` Yeah , look , they 're coming round now , '' 
`` Feel all right ? '' 
`` Make us write lines ? '' 
`` You would n't , '' 
`` Let her sleep , '' 
`` All right , Ron ? '' 
`` Hey , Potter , how 's your scar feeling ? '' 
`` Ron 's making a right pig 's ear of things , is n't he ? '' 
`` And then T , '' 
`` ` Troll , ' '' 
`` Just now , before lunch , '' 
`` I ca n't see old Flitwick getting marked down , '' 
`` he usually gets everyone through their exams all right . '' 
`` Well , be a good boy and keep your temper with Umbridge today , '' 
`` Would you like us to clean out your ears for you ? '' 
`` Knew you 'd say that , '' 
`` If only I had n't offered to sell her some Puking Pastilles yesterday -- '' 
`` We could try the Fever Fudge , '' 
`` no one 's seen that yet -- '' 
`` Does it work ? '' 
`` and we have n't worked out how to get rid of them yet . '' 
`` Mine have n't , '' 
`` Sorry , Harry , '' 
`` He 'd just lost , had n't he , of course he wanted to provoke you ! But what on earth he can have said that justified what you two -- '' 
`` He insulted my parents , '' 
`` Hem , hem . '' 
`` Headless Hats ! '' 
`` And off again ! '' 
`` Harry ? HARRY ! '' 
`` Come on , Ginny 's not bad , '' 
`` Oh , '' 
`` The Snackboxes are ready to roll , we found out how to get rid of those boils , just a couple of drops of murtlap essence sorts them , Lee put us onto it ... '' 
`` Simply splendid to see you , old boy -- '' 
`` Marvelous , '' 
`` This , Harry , is the secret of our success , '' 
`` Anyway , we know it by heart , '' 
`` It 's not as bad as it sounds , you know , '' 
`` Oh , are we ? '' 
`` I solemnly swear that I am up to no good . '' 
`` Moony , Pettigrewl Padfoot , and James , '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` See you in Honeydukes , '' 
`` All he did was eat and sleep , Ron , you said it yourself , '' 
`` Come on , Harry ! '' 
`` Well done , '' 
`` The one we 've all been waiting for , '' 
`` Why are n't you wearing yours , Ron ? '' 
`` You have n't got a letter on yours , '' 
`` And you 're not sitting with the prefects today , either , '' 
`` That 's exactly the sort of thing that 'll lose us the match ! Snape 's refereeing this time , and he 'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! '' 
`` Snape 's refereeing ? '' 
`` When 's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He 's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . ''
