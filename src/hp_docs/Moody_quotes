`` That 's brilliant , congrat -- '' 
`` All right , all right , we 'll have time for a cozy catch-up later , '' 
`` Good luck , everyone , '' 
`` See you all in about an hour at the Burrow . On the count of three . One ... two ... THREE . '' 
`` Severus Snape ? '' 
`` I do n't think so ! '' 
`` I do n't like people who attack when their opponent 's back 's turned , '' 
`` Never -- do -- that -- again -- '' 
`` Hello , Professor Minerva McGonagall , '' 
`` Teaching , '' 
`` Yep , '' 
`` He might 've mentioned it , yeah , '' 
`` but I thought a good sharp shock -- '' 
`` We give detentions , Moody ! Or speak to the offender 's Head of House ! '' 
`` I 'll do that , then , '' 
`` my father '' 
`` Oh yeah ? '' 
`` Another old friend , '' 
`` I 've been looking forward to a chat with old Snape ... Come on , you ... '' 
`` You can put those away , '' 
`` those books . You wo n't need them . '' 
`` Right then , '' 
`` But you 're behind -- very behind -- on dealing with curses , '' 
`` You 'll be Arthur Weasley 's son , eh ? '' 
`` Your father got me out of a very tight corner a few days ago ... Yeah , I 'm staying just the one year . Special favor to Dumbledore ... One year , and then back to my quiet retirement . '' 
`` Think it 's funny , do you ? '' 
`` Total control , '' 
`` Years back , there were a lot of witches and wizards being controlled by the Imperius Curse , '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` Yes , the last and worst . Avada Kedavra ... the Killing Curse . '' 
`` Me , '' 
`` You ca n't leave your champion now . He 's got to compete . They 've all got to compete . Binding magical contract , like Dumbledore said . Convenient , eh ? '' 
`` Do n't you ? '' 
`` I shall be lodging complaints with the Ministry of Magic and the International Confederation of Wizards -- '' 
`` If anyone 's got reason to complain , it 's Potter , '' 
`` but ... funny thing ... I do n't hear him saying a word ... '' 
`` Why should ' e complain ? '' 
`` Maybe someone 's hoping Potter is going to die for it , '' 
`` Imagining things , am I ? '' 
`` Because they hoodwinked a very powerful magical object ! '' 
`` Yeah , it can see through Invisibility Cloaks , '' 
`` Nice socks , Potter , '' 
`` Hello , Potter , '' 
`` Come in here . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Of course , '' 
`` There are other ways he could have disappeared , are n't there , Professor ? '' 
`` You 're another one who might think about a career as an Auror , '' 
`` We ca n't rule out kidnap , '' 
`` Could be anywhere , '' 
`` Only thing we know for sure is that he 's not here . '' 
`` Now , Dumbledore 's told me you three fancy yourselves as investigators , but there 's nothing you can do for Crouch . The Ministry 'll be looking for him now , Dumbledore 's notified them . Potter , you just keep your mind on the third task . '' 
`` Should be right up your street , this one , '' 
`` Well , help him practice for this one , and I 'll be very surprised if he does n't win , '' 
`` In the meantime ... constant vigilance , Potter . Constant vigilance . '' 
`` You two , '' 
`` And what do you thinks happened to Barty Crouch , Minister ? '' 
`` Can we wrap up this discussion ? '' 
`` No , it 's not that , '' 
`` it 's just that Potter wants a word with you , Dumbledore . He 's just outside the door . '' 
`` Hello , Potter , '' 
`` Crouch is going to let him out , '' 
`` Ah , I was forgetting ... you do n't like the dementors , do you , Albus Dumbledore ? '' 
`` But for filth like this ... '' 
`` -- we never knew the names of every one of our fellows -- He alone knew exactly who we all were -- '' 
`` Which was a wise move , was n't it , as it prevented someone like you , Karkaroff , from turning all of them in , '' 
`` And helped him do it , '' 
`` Took a bit of me with him , though , '' 
`` Drink it ... you 'll feel better ... come on , now , Harry , I need to know exactly what happened ... '' 
`` What did the Dark Lord take from you ? '' 
`` I know who the Death Eater is , '' 
`` Karkaroff ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` You did n't do that ... you ca n't have done ... '' 
`` I assure you I did , '' 
`` I asked you , '' 
`` whether he forgave the scum who never even went to look for him . Those treacherous cowards who would n't even brave Azkaban for him . The faithless , worthless bits of filth who were brave enough to cavort in masks at the Quidditch World Cup , but fled at the sight of the Dark Mark when I fired it into the sky . '' 
`` I told you , Harry ... I told you . If there 's one thing I hate more than any other , it 's a Death Eater who walked free . They turned their backs on my master when he needed them most . I expected him to punish them . I expected him to torture them . Tell me he CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE ` 676 ` hurt them , Harry ... '' 
`` Who put your name in the Goblet of Fire , under the name of a different school ? I did . Who frightened off every person I thought might try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tournament ? I did . Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons ? I did . Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon ? I did . '' 
`` You had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze tonight , of course , '' 
`` The Dark Lord did n't manage to kill you , Potter , and he so wanted to , '' 
`` Imagine how he will reward me when he finds I have done it for him . I gave you to him -- the thing he needed above all to regenerate -- and then I killed you for him . I will be honored beyond all other Death Eaters . I will be his dearest , his closest supporter ... closer than a son ... '' 
`` Mad , am I ? '' 
`` We 'll see ! We 'll see who 's mad , now that the Dark Lord has returned , VERITASERUM ` 679 ` with me at his side ! He is back , Harry Potter , you did not conquer him -- and now -- I conquer you ! '' 
`` Stunned -- controlled by the Imperius Curse -- very weak , '' 
`` Not here , boy ! '' 
`` Come on , hurry , '' 
`` Here -- ''
