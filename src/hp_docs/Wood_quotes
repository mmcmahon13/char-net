`` There you are , Harry , what kept you ? '' 
`` Quidditch matches are back on ! '' 
`` You know what ? I can manage him along , Neville , '' 
`` This is our last chance -- my last chance -- to win the Quidditch Cup , '' 
`` It 's going to be a tough one , '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` But Black could n't have bought a Firebolt ! He 's on the run ! The whole country 's on the lookout for him ! How could he just walk into Quality Quidditch Supplies and buy a broomstick ? '' 
`` Bad news , Harry . I 've just been to see Professor Minerva McGonagall about the Firebolt . She -- er -- got a bit shirty with me . Told m ' I 'd got my priorities wrong . Seemed to think I cared more about winning the Cup than I do about you staying alive . Just because I told her I did n't care if it threw you off , as long as you caught the Snitch first . '' 
`` Er -- Madam Hooch ? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back ? We need to practice ... '' 
`` Harry , I 've just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker . It 's Cho Chang . She 's a fourth year , and she 's pretty good ... I really hoped she would n't be fit , she 's had some problems with injuries ... '' 
`` I ca n't see what 's going to stop us tomorrow ! '' 
`` Well , let 's hope not , '' 
`` He ca n't believe it ! This is brilliant ! '' 
`` You know what we 've got to do , '' 
`` That 's my boy ! '' 
`` So you must catch it only if we 're more than fifty points up , '' 
`` Team ! Bed ! '' 
`` Where were you ? We had to use Neville instead ! '' 
`` Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? '' 
`` Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood -- I 've found you a Seeker . '' 
`` Did n't even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley could n't have done it . '' 
`` Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ? '' 
`` He 's just the build for a Seeker , too , '' 
`` Very nice , '' 
`` I see what Minerva McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural . I 'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you 'll be joining team practice three times a week . '' 
`` Right , '' 
`` This ball 's called the Quaffle , '' 
`` What 's basketball ? '' 
`` I 'll show you now , '' 
`` Take this . '' 
`` I 'm going to show you what the Bludgers do , '' 
`` These two are the Bludgers . '' 
`` Stand back , '' 
`` See ? '' 
`` Very good , '' 
`` This , '' 
`` Okay , men , '' 
`` And women , '' 
`` Shut up , you two , '' 
`` This is the best team Gryffindor 's had in years . We 're going to win . I know it . '' 
`` Or else . '' 
`` Will you stop messing around ! '' 
`` It 's not my fault , '' 
`` Do n't nag . ''
