`` What is this ? What 's happened , Cissy ? '' 
`` Potter ? '' 
`` Do not touch it , we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now ! '' 
`` Draco , move this scum outside , '' 
`` Do it ! You have no idea of the danger we 're in ! '' 
`` Wait , '' 
`` You can have me , keep me ! '' 
`` Hello , Dean ! '' 
`` How did you get into my vault ? '' 
`` A copy ? '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Are you sure ? '' 
`` we can dispose of the Mudblood . Greyback , take her if you want her . '' 
`` Who has volunteered to demonstrate what happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost ? '' 
`` What will happen to your children when I 've killed you ? '' 
`` why I stood between the Dark Lord and the Sorcerer 's Stone . That is easily answered . He did not know whether he could trust me . He thought , like you , that I had turned from faithful Death Eater to Dumbledore 's stooge . He was in a pitiable condition , very weak , sharing the body of a mediocre wizard . He did not dare reveal himself to a former ally if that ally might turn him over to Dumbledore or the Ministry . I deeply regret that he did not trust me . He would have returned to power three years sooner . As it was , I saw only greedy and unworthy Quirrell attempting to steal the stone and , I admit , I did all I could to thwart him . '' 
`` And through all this we are supposed to believe Dumbledore has never suspected you ? '' 
`` And you overlook Dumbledore 's greatest weakness : He has to believe the best of people . I spun him a tale of deepest remorse when I joined his staff , fresh from my Death Eater days , and he embraced me with open arms -- though , as I say , never allowing me nearer the Dark Arts than he could help . Dumbledore has been a great wizard -- oh yes , he has , '' 
`` the Dark Lord acknowledges it . I am pleased to say , however , that Dumbledore is growing old . The duel with the Dark Lord last month shook him . He has since sustained a serious injury because his reactions are slower than they once were . But through all these years , he has never stopped trusting Severus Snape , and therein lies my great value to the Dark Lord . '' 
`` You know about the plan ? '' 
`` My son ... my only son ... '' 
`` Draco Malfoy should be proud , '' 
`` How can he , when the Dark Lord himself -- ? '' 
`` You should be proud ! '' 
`` Perhaps your sister will consent to be our Bonder . '' 
`` What kind of prophecy ? '' 
`` You dare speak his name ? '' 
`` Yeah , I 've got no problem saying Vol -- '' 
`` Shut your mouth ! '' 
`` NO ! '' 
`` He dared -- he dares -- '' 
`` Get it himself ? '' 
`` Potter , I am going to give you one chance ! '' 
`` Master , I am sorry , I knew not , I was fighting the Animagus Black ! '' 
`` MASTER ! ''
