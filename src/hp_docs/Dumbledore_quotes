'' Malfoy bent down to examine a shelf full of skulls . '' 
`` Please explain why you did this . '' 
`` Not today , Mr. Weasley , '' 
`` Professor Dumbledore , these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of Underage Wizardry , caused serious damage to an old and valuable tree - surely acts of this nature - '' 
`` It will be for Professor Minerva McGonagall to decide on these boys ' punishments , Severus , '' 
`` They are in her House and are therefore her responsibility . '' 
`` You ! You 've murdered my cat ! You 've killed her ! I 'll kill you ! I 'll - '' 
`` Argus ! '' 
`` My office is nearest , Headmaster - just upstairs - please feel free - '' 
`` Thank you , Gilderoy , '' 
`` She has been Petrified , '' 
`` Ah ! I thought so ! '' 
`` No second year could have done this , '' 
`` He knows I 'm a Squib ! '' 
`` We will be able to cure her , Argus , '' 
`` You may go , '' 
`` Get Madam Pomfrey , '' 
`` Another attack , '' 
`` No , Harry , I do n't , '' 
`` I must ask you , Harry , whether there is anything you 'd like to tell me , '' 
`` Well , hurry off to bed , '' 
`` The appointment - or suspension - of the headmaster is a matter for the governors , Fudge , '' 
`` No , I 'm sorry , there 's every chance the attacker might come back to finish these people off ... '' 
`` I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me ... Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it . '' 
`` I found it inside one of the books Mum got me . I th-thought someone had just left it in there and forgotten about it -- '' 
`` Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away , '' 
`` This has been a terrible ordeal for her . There will be no punishment . Older and wiser wizards than she have been hoodwinked by Lord Voldemort . '' 
`` Bed rest and perhaps a large , steaming mug of hot chocolate . I always find that cheers me up , '' 
`` There has been no lasting harm done , Ginny , '' 
`` Certainly , '' 
`` Sit down , Harry , '' 
`` First of all , Harry , I want to thank you , '' 
`` You must have shown me real loyalty down in the Chamber . Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you . '' 
`` And so you met Tom Tom Riddle , '' 
`` If you want proof , Harry , that you belong in Gryffindor , I suggest you look more closely at this . '' 
`` And imagine , '' 
`` Very fortunate , '' 
`` Oh , no one will be able to do that , '' 
`` Lucius , '' 
`` I 've got something for you -- '' 
`` Mrs. -- Miss -- Bagshot ? '' 
`` Harry . '' 
`` Look at the signature , Harry ! '' 
`` Help us ! '' 
`` You could n't have broken into Dumbledore 's grave . '' 
`` I -- I come with a warning -- no , a request -- please -- '' 
`` The -- the prophecy ... the prediction ... Trelawney ... '' 
`` Ah , yes , '' 
`` The prophecy did not refer to a woman , '' 
`` You know what I mean ! He thinks it means her son , he is going to hunt her down -- kill them all -- '' 
`` If she means so much to you , '' 
`` surely Lord Voldemort will spare her ? Could you not ask for mercy for the mother , in exchange for the son ? '' 
`` I have -- I have asked him -- '' 
`` You disgust me , '' 
`` I thought ... you were going ... to keep her ... safe ... '' 
`` She and James put their faith in the wrong person , '' 
`` Her boy survives , '' 
`` And what use would that be to anyone ? '' 
`` My word , Severus , that I shall never reveal the best of you ? '' 
`` -- mediocre , arrogant as his father , a determined rule-breaker , delighted to find himself famous , attention-seeking and impertinent -- '' 
`` You see what you expect to see , Severus , '' 
`` Other teachers report that the boy is modest , likable , and reasonably talented . Personally , I find him an engaging child . '' 
`` Keep an eye on Quirrell , wo n't you ? '' 
`` Well ? '' 
`` Does he ? '' 
`` No , '' 
`` You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff . You know , I sometimes think we Sort too soon ... '' 
`` I. . . was a fool . Sorely tempted ... '' 
`` Tempted by what ? '' 
`` That ring carried a curse of extraordinary power , to contain it is all we can hope for ; I have trapped the curse in one hand for the time being -- '' 
`` You have done very well , Severus . How long do you think I have ? '' 
`` Something like that ... I was delirious , no doubt ... '' 
`` In short , the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have , '' 
`` And if it does fall into his grasp , '' 
`` I have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts ? '' 
`` Oh , not quite yet , '' 
`` I daresay the moment will present itself in due course . Given what has happened tonight , '' 
`` we can be sure that it will happen within a year . '' 
`` That boy 's soul is not yet so damaged , '' 
`` You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and humiliation , '' 
`` Voldemort fears that connection , '' 
`` In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort , to speak of one is to speak of the other . '' 
`` Come to my office tonight , Severus , at eleven , and you shall not complain that I have no confidence in you ... '' 
`` Tell him what ? '' 
`` We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him , to raise him , to let him try his strength , '' 
`` Meanwhile , the connection between them grows ever stronger , a parasitic growth . Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself . If I know him , he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death , it will truly mean the end of Voldemort . '' 
`` I have spied for you and lied for you , put myself in mortal danger for you . Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter 's son safe . Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter -- '' 
`` But this is touching , Severus , '' 
`` You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry 's departure from 581 his aunt and uncle 's , '' 
`` Good . Very good ! '' 
`` No , I do n't think so , '' 
`` The Cloak , as you know now , traveled down through the ages , father to son , mother to daughter , right down to Ignotus 's last living descendant , who was born , as Ignotus was , in the village of Godric 's Hollow . '' 
`` True , '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` But I do n't despise you -- '' 
`` Then you should , '' 
`` Would I ? '' 
`` Oh , not death , '' 
`` But the Cloak , I took out of vain curiosity , and so it could never have worked for me as it works for you , its true owner . The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who are at peace , rather than to enable my self-sacrifice , as you did . You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows . '' 
`` Why did you have to make it so difficult ? '' 
`` My dear boy , I do , '' 
`` back where it came from . It can stay there . If I die a natural death like Ignotus , its power will be broken , wo n't it ? The previous master will never have been defeated . That 'll be the end of it . '' 
`` I have only two words to say to you , '' 
`` So ! '' 
`` This is due to an event that will be starting in October , and continuing throughout the school year , taking up much of the teachers ' time and energy -- but I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely . I have great pleasure in announcing that this year at Hogwarts -- '' 
`` May I introduce our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher ? '' 
`` As I was saying , '' 
`` I am not joking , Mr. Weasley , '' 
`` though now that you mention it , I did hear an excellent one over the summer about a troll , a hag , and a leprechaun who all go into a bar ... '' 
`` Er -- but maybe this is not the time ... no ... '' 
`` Eager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard Cup to Hogwarts , '' 
`` the heads of the participating schools , along with the Ministry of Magic , have agreed to impose an age restriction on contenders this year . Only students who are of age -- that is to say , seventeen years or older -- will be allowed to put forward their names for consideration . This '' 
`` Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , ghosts and -- most particularly -- guests , '' 
`` The tournament will be officially opened at the end of the feast , '' 
`` I now invite you all to eat , drink , and make yourselves at home ! '' 
`` The moment has come , '' 
`` Ludo Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the last few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tournament , '' 
`` and they will be joining myself , Professor Karkaroff , and Madame Maxime on the panel that will judge the champions ' efforts . '' 
`` The casket , then , if you please , Mr. Filch . '' 
`` The instructions for the tasks the champions will face this year have already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Ludo Bagman , '' 
`` and they have made the necessary arrangements for each challenge . There will be three tasks , spaced throughout the school year , and they will test the champions in many different ways ... their magical prowess -- their daring -- their powers of deduction -- and , of course , their ability to cope with danger . '' 
`` As you know , three champions compete in the tournament , '' 
`` one from each of the participating schools . They will be marked on how well they perform each of the Tournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after task three will win the Triwizard Cup . The champions will be chosen by an impartial selector : the Goblet of Fire . '' 
`` Anybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write their name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it into the goblet , '' 
`` The champion for Beauxbatons , '' 
`` is Fleur Delacour ! '' 
`` The Hogwarts champion , '' 
`` is Cedric Diggory ! '' 
`` Excellent ! '' 
`` Well , we now have our three champions . I am sure I can count upon all of you , including the remaining students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang , to give your champions every ounce of support you can muster . By cheering your champion on , you will contribute in a very real -- '' 
`` Harry Potter . '' 
`` Harry Potter ! '' 
`` Well ... through the door , Harry , '' 
`` Do n't go blaming Dumbledore for Potter 's determination to break rules . He has been crossing lines ever since he arrived here -- '' 
`` Thank you , Severus , '' 
`` Did you put your name into the Goblet of Fire , Harry ? '' 
`` It is possible , of course , '' 
`` Dumbledore , you know perfectly well you did not make a THE FOUR CHAMPIONS ` 277 ` mistake ! '' 
`` Mad-Eye ! '' 
`` How this situation arose , we do not know , '' 
`` It seems to me , however , that we have no choice but to accept it . Both Cedric and Harry have been chosen to compete in the Tournament . This , therefore , they will do ... '' 
`` Ah , but Dumbly-dorr -- '' 
`` My dear Madame Maxime , if you have an alternative , I would be delighted to hear it . '' 
`` I think so , '' 
`` You 'll come and have a drink before you go , at least ? '' 
`` Professor Karkaroff -- Madame Maxime -- a nightcap ? '' 
`` Harry , Cedric , I suggest you go up to bed , '' 
`` I did n't , '' 
`` Enchantingly nasty , '' 
`` I was just making the point that some of your ideas are a little old-fashioned , Dumbledore , and that many wizards in the street -- '' 
`` I will be delighted to hear the reasoning behind the rudeness , Rita , '' 
`` but I 'm afraid we will have to discuss the matter later . The Weighing of the Wands is about to start , and it can not take place if one of our champions is hidden in a broom cupboard . '' 
`` May I introduce Mr. Ollivander ? '' 
`` Thank you all , '' 
`` Pork chops ! '' 
`` Oh I would never dream of assuming I know all Hogwarts ' secrets , Igor , '' 
`` Yes , I surmised as much , '' 
`` More tea , I think , '' 
`` Did you by any chance hear what Miss Granger was shouting , Hagrid ? '' 
`` I have gone temporarily deaf and have n't any idea what you said , Harry , '' 
`` Living proof of what I 've been telling you , Hagrid , '' 
`` Really , Hagrid , if you are holding out for universal popularity , I 'm afraid you will be in this cabin for a very long time , '' 
`` I refuse to accept your resignation , Hagrid , and I expect you back at work on Monday , '' 
`` You will join me for breakfast at eight-thirty in the Great Hall . No excuses . Good afternoon to you all . '' 
`` Either Crouch has finally cracked -- more than likely , I 'm sure you 'll agree , given his personal history -- lost his mind , and gone wandering off somewhere -- '' 
`` He wandered extremely quickly , if that is the case , Cornelius , '' 
`` I consider her to be a very able headmistress -- and an excellent dancer , '' 
`` Do n't you think you might be prejudiced in her favor because of Hagrid ? They do n't all turn out harmless -- if , indeed , you can call Hagrid harmless , with that monster fixation he 's got -- '' 
`` I no more suspect Madame Maxime than Hagrid , '' 
`` Wait here for me , Harry , '' 
`` Our examination of the grounds will not take long . '' 
`` I 'm sorry -- I did n't mean to -- I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet -- I -- where are we ? '' 
`` Filth . '' 
`` He 's done a deal with him . Took me six months to track him down , and Crouch is going to let him go if he 's got enough new names . Let 's hear his information , I say , and throw him straight back to the dementors . '' 
`` No , '' 
`` I 'm afraid I do n't . I have long felt the Ministry is wrong to ally itself with such creatures . '' 
`` I assure you ! Severus Snape is a Death Eater ! '' 
`` I have given evidence already on this matter , '' 
`` Come , '' 
`` This ? It is called a Pensieve , '' 
`` At these times , '' 
`` I use the Pensieve . One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one 's mind , pours them into the basin , and examines them at one 's leisure . It becomes easier to spot patterns and links , you understand , when they are in this form . '' 
`` Certainly , '' 
`` Let me show you . '' 
`` It 's coming back ... Karkaroff 's too ... stronger and clearer than ever ... '' 
`` A connection I could have made without assistance , '' 
`` but never mind . '' 
`` Curiosity is not a sin , '' 
`` But we should exercise caution with our curiosity ... yes , indeed ... '' 
`` He put a hex on me , Professor Dumbledore , and I THE PENSIEVE ` 599 ` was only teasing him , sir . I only said I 'd seen him kissing Florence behind the greenhouses last Thursday ... '' 
`` But why , Bertha , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` That was Bertha as I remember her at school . '' 
`` So , Harry , '' 
`` Professor -- I was in Divination just now , and -- er -- I fell asleep . '' 
`` Quite understandable . Continue . '' 
`` A dream about Lord Voldemort . He was torturing Pettigrew ... you know who Pettigrew -- '' 
`` I do know , '' 
`` It woke me up , it hurt so badly . '' 
`` I see , '' 
`` You are not Sirius 's only correspondent , '' 
`` I have also been in contact with him ever since he left Hogwarts last year . It was I who suggested the mountainside cave as the safest place for him to stay . '' 
`` My apologies , '' 
`` D’you -- d’you know why my scar 's hurting me ? '' 
`` Because you and he are connected by the curse that failed , '' 
`` It is possible , '' 
`` How indeed ? '' 
`` How indeed ... '' 
`` Voldemort ? '' 
`` Once again , Harry , I can only give you my suspicions . '' 
`` The years of Voldemort 's ascent to power , '' 
`` were marked with disappearances . Bertha Jorkins has vanished without a trace in the place where Voldemort was certainly known to be last . Mr. Crouch too has disappeared ... within these very grounds . And there was a third disappearance , one which the Ministry , I regret to say , do not consider of any importance , for it concerns a Muggle . His name was Frank Bryce , he lived in the village where CHAPTER THIRTY ` 602 ` Voldemort 's father grew up , and he has not been seen since last August . You see , I read the Muggle newspapers , unlike most of my Ministry friends . '' 
`` Yes , Harry ? '' 
`` You could , '' 
`` You know -- you know the trial you found me in ? The one with Crouch 's son ? Well ... were they talking about Neville 's parents ? '' 
`` Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother ? '' 
`` Yes , they were talking about Neville 's parents , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` And ... er ... '' 
`` What made you think he 'd really stopped supporting Voldemort , Professor ? '' 
`` Harry , '' 
`` And I answer myself , perhaps they believed a still greater power could exist , one that could vanquish even Lord Voldemort ... perhaps they now pay allegiance to another ... perhaps that champion of commoners , of Mudbloods and Muggles , Albus Dumbledore Dumbledore ? '' 
`` He wanted me to bring him back to his parents ... '' 
`` That 's right , Harry ... just let go now ... '' 
`` Come along ... hospital wing ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Dumbledore , he ought to -- look at him -- he 's been through enough tonight -- '' 
`` He will stay , Minerva , because he needs to understand , '' 
`` This is not Mad-Eye Moody , '' 
`` You have never known Mad-Eye Moody . The real Moody would not have removed you from my sight after what happened tonight . The moment he took you , I knew -- and I followed . '' 
`` Polyjuice Potion , Harry , '' 
`` You see the simplicity of it , and the brilliance . For Moody never does drink except from his hip flask , he 's well known for it . The imposter needed , of course , to keep the real Moody close by , so that he could continue making the potion . You see his hair ... '' 
`` The imposter has been cutting it off all year , see where it is uneven ? But I think , in the excitement of tonight , our fake Moody might have forgotten to take it as frequently as he should have done ... on the hour ... every hour ... We shall see . '' 
`` He is simply Stunned , Winky , '' 
`` Can you hear me ? '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I would like you to tell us , '' 
`` how you came to be here . How did you escape from Azkaban ? '' 
`` Map ? '' 
`` And tonight ... '' 
`` I offered to carry the Triwizard Cup into the maze before dinner , '' 
`` Severus '' 
`` Harry ? '' 
`` I want you to come up to my office first , Harry , '' 
`` They are with Professor Sprout , '' 
`` Harry , are you all right ? I knew it -- I knew something like this -- what happened ? '' 
`` I need to know what happened after you touched the Portkey in the maze , Harry , '' 
`` If I thought I could help you , '' 
`` by putting you into an enchanted sleep and allowing you to postpone the moment when you would have to think about what has happened tonight , I would do it . But I know better . Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it . You have shown bravery beyond anything I could have expected of you . I ask you to demonstrate your courage one more time . I ask you to tell us what happened . '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Harry 's wand and Voldemort 's wand share cores . Each of them contains a feather from the tail of the same phoenix . This phoenix , in fact , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` They will not work properly against each other , '' 
`` If , however , the owners of the wands force the wands to do battle ... a very rare effect will take place . One of the wands will force the other to regurgitate spells it has performed -- in reverse . The most recent first ... and then those which preceded it ... '' 
`` Which means , '' 
`` No spell can reawaken the dead , '' 
`` An echo , '' 
`` which retained Cedric 's appearance and character . I am guessing other such forms appeared ... less recent victims of Voldemort 's wand ... '' 
`` Your parents ? '' 
`` The last murders the wand performed , '' 
`` I will say it again , '' 
`` Molly , '' 
`` please listen to me for a moment . Harry has been through a terrible ordeal tonight . He has just had to relive it for me . What he needs now is sleep , and peace , and quiet . If he would like you all to stay with him , '' 
`` This dog will be remaining with Harry for a while , '' 
`` I will be back to see you as soon as I have met with Fudge , Harry , '' 
`` I would like you to remain here tomorrow until I have spoken to the school . '' 
`` This is a hospital wing , Minister , do n't you think you 'd do better to -- '' 
`` What has happened ? '' 
`` But he can not now give testimony , Cornelius , '' 
`` Lord Voldemort was giving him instructions , Cornelius , '' 
`` Voldemort ... returned ? Preposterous . Come now , Dumbledore ... '' 
`` As Minerva and Severus have doubtless told you , '' 
`` we heard Barry Crouch confess . Under the influence of Veritaserum , he told us how he was smuggled out of Azkaban , and how Voldemort -- learning of his continued existence from Bertha Jorkins -- went to free him from his father and used him to capture Harry . The plan worked , I tell you . Crouch has helped Voldemort to return . '' 
`` When Harry touched the Triwizard Cup tonight , he was transported straight to Voldemort , '' 
`` He witnessed Lord Voldemort 's rebirth . I will explain it all to you if you will step up to my office . '' 
`` I am afraid I can not permit you to question Harry tonight . '' 
`` Certainly , I believe Harry , '' 
`` I assume that you are referring to the pains Harry has been experiencing in his scar ? '' 
`` Listen to me , Cornelius , '' 
`` Voldemort has returned , '' 
`` The rest of us sleep less soundly in our beds , Cornelius , knowing that you have put Lord Voldemort 's most dangerous supporters in the care of creatures who will join him the instant he asks them ! '' 
`` The second step you must take -- and at once , '' 
`` is to send envoys to the giants . '' 
`` Extend them the hand of friendship , now , before it is too late , '' 
`` or Voldemort will persuade them , as he did before , that he alone among wizards will give them their rights and their freedom ! '' 
`` If the magical community got wind that I had approached the giants -- people hate them , Dumbledore -- end of my career -- '' 
`` You are blinded , '' 
`` by the love of the office you hold , Cornelius ! You place too much importance , and you always have done , on the so-called purity of blood ! You fail to recognize that it matters not what someone is born , but what they grow to be ! Your dementor has just destroyed the last remaining member of a pure-blood family as old as any -- and see what that man chose to make of his life ! I tell you now -- take the steps I have suggested , and you will be remembered , in office or out , as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers of Magic we have ever known . Fail to act -- and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild ! '' 
`` If your determination to shut your eyes will carry you as far as this , Cornelius , '' 
`` we have reached a parting of the ways . You must act as you see fit . And I -- I shall act as I see fit . '' 
`` Now , see here , Dumbledore , '' 
`` I 've given you free rein , always . I 've had a lot of respect for you . I might not have agreed with some of your decisions , but I 've kept quiet . There are n't many who 'd have let you hire werewolves , or keep Hagrid , or decide what to teach your students without reference to the Ministry . But if you 're going to work against me -- '' 
`` The only one against whom I intend to work , '' 
`` is Lord Voldemort . If you are against him , then we remain , Cornelius , on the same side . '' 
`` He ca n't be back , Dumbledore , he just ca n't be ... '' 
`` I do n't know what you and your staff are playing at , Dumbledore , but I have heard enough . I have no more to add . I will be in touch with you tomorrow , Dumbledore , to discuss the running of this school . I must return to the Ministry . '' 
`` Then I need to send a message to Arthur , '' 
`` Excellent , '' 
`` Minerva , '' 
`` Poppy , '' 
`` would you be very kind and go down to Professor Moody 's office , where I think you will find a house-elf called Winky in considerable distress ? Do what you can for her , and take her back to the kitchens . I think Dobby will look after her for us . '' 
`` And now , '' 
`` it is time for two of our number to recognize each other for what they are . Sirius ... if you could resume your usual form . '' 
`` He is here at my invitation , '' 
`` as are you , Severus . I trust you both . It is time for you to lay aside your old differences and trust each other . '' 
`` I will settle , in the short term , '' 
`` for a lack of open hostility . You will shake hands . You are on the same side now . Time is short , and unless the few of us who know the truth do not stand united , there is no hope for any of us . '' 
`` That will do to be going on with , '' 
`` Severus , '' 
`` Then good luck , '' 
`` I must go downstairs , '' 
`` The end , '' 
`` of another year . '' 
`` There is much that I would like to say to you all tonight , '' 
`` but I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine person , who should be sitting here , '' 
`` Cedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that distinguish Hufflepuff house , '' 
`` The Ministry of Magic , '' 
`` does not wish me to tell you this . It is possible that some of your parents will be horrified that I have done so -- either because they will not believe that Lord Voldemort has returned , or because they think I should not tell you so , young as you are . It is my belief , however , that the truth is generally preferable to lies , and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as the result of an accident , or some sort of blunder of his own , is an insult to his memory . '' 
`` There is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection with Cedric 's death , '' 
`` Harry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort , '' 
`` He risked his own life to return Cedric 's body to Hogwarts . He showed , in every respect , the sort of bravery that few THE BEGINNING ` 723 ` wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort , and for this , I honor him . '' 
`` The Triwizard Tournament 's aim was to further and promote magical understanding . In the light of what has happened -- of Lord Voldemort 's return -- such ties are more important than ever before . '' 
`` Every guest in this Hall , '' 
`` Yes , indeed we are , but there are a few matters we need to discuss first , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I shall . '' 
`` We may as well be comfortable , '' 
`` Later , Harry , '' 
`` I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment , '' 
`` Madam Rosmerta 's finest oak-matured mead , '' 
`` Well , Harry , '' 
`` a difficulty has arisen which I hope you will be able to solve for us . By us , I mean the Order of the Phoenix . But first of all I must tell you that WILL AND WO N'T ` 49 ` Sirius 's will was discovered a week ago and that he left you everything he owned . '' 
`` This is , in the main , fairly straightforward , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Our problem , '' 
`` That is generous , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` Quite , '' 
`` And if such an enchantment exists , then the ownership of the house is most likely to pass to the eldest of Sirius 's living relatives , which would mean his cousin , Bellatrix Lestrange . '' 
`` Well , obviously we would prefer that she did n't get it either , '' 
`` Fortunately , '' 
`` there is a simple test . '' 
`` Oh , I 'm so sorry , '' 
`` You see , '' 
`` Kreacher , '' 
`` Kreacher belongs to Miss Bellatrix , oh yes , Kreacher belongs to the Blacks , Kreacher wants his new mistress , Kreacher wo n't go to the Potter brat , Kreacher wo n't , wo n't , wo n't -- '' 
`` As you can see , Harry , '' 
`` Give him an order , '' 
`` Well , that simplifies matters , '' 
`` Not if you do n't want to , '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` Hagrid will be delighted , '' 
`` Erm ... '' 
`` Doubtful that I would turn up ? '' 
`` Good , '' 
`` Just one last thing , then . '' 
`` I 'm sorry ? '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` but in the Wizarding world , we come of age at seventeen . '' 
`` Now , as you already know , the wizard called Lord Voldemort has returned to this country . The Wizarding community is currently in a state of open warfare . Harry , whom Lord Voldemort has already attempted to kill on a number of occasions , is in even greater danger now than the day when I left him upon your doorstep fifteen years ago , with a letter explaining about his parents ' murder and expressing the hope that you would care for him as though he were your own . '' 
`` Well , Harry ... time for us to be off , '' 
`` Until we meet again , '' 
`` Keep your wand at the ready , Harry , '' 
`` If there is an attack , '' 
`` I give you permission to use any counterjinx or curse that might occur to you . However , I do not think you need worry about being attacked tonight . '' 
`` You are with me , '' 
`` This will do , Harry . '' 
`` You have not , of course , passed your Apparition Test , '' 
`` You do , '' 
`` Very good , '' 
`` Are you all right ? '' 
`` But I think I might prefer brooms ... '' 
`` This way . '' 
`` So tell me , Harry , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` and I 've been wondering about that . I thought it would be burning all the time now Voldemort 's getting so powerful again . '' 
`` I , on the other hand , thought otherwise , '' 
`` Ah yes , of course , I have n't told you , '' 
`` Oh , I think we 'll find a use for you , '' 
`` Because it would be quite as rude as kicking down the front door , '' 
`` Sir , I saw in the Daily Prophet that Fudge has been sacked ... '' 
`` Correct , '' 
`` An interesting question , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` A terrible loss . She was a great witch . Just up here , I think -- ouch . '' 
`` I have no time to explain now , '' 
`` It is a thrilling tale , I wish to do it justice . '' 
`` Sir -- I got a Ministry of Magic leaflet by owl , about security measures we should all take against the Death Eaters ... '' 
`` Yes , I received one myself , '' 
`` They are corpses , '' 
`` Wand out and follow me , Harry , '' 
`` Lumos . '' 
`` Not pretty , is it ? '' 
`` Yes , something horrible has happened here . '' 
`` I do n't think so , '' 
`` Still here somewhere ? Yes . '' 
`` Ouch ! '' 
`` Good evening , Horace , '' 
`` There was no need to stick the wand in that hard , '' 
`` What gave it away ? '' 
`` My dear Horace , '' 
`` if the Death Eaters really had come to call , the Dark Mark would have been set over the house . '' 
`` The Dark Mark , '' 
`` Knew there was something ... ah well . Would n't have had time anyway , I 'd only just put the finishing touches to my upholstery when you entered the room . '' 
`` Would you like my assistance clearing up ? '' 
`` What kind of blood was that , incidentally ? '' 
`` This , '' 
`` is Harry Potter . Harry , this is an old friend and colleague of mine , Horace Slughorn . '' 
`` I suppose we can have a drink , at least ? '' 
`` Well , how have you been keeping , Horace ? '' 
`` And yet you must have moved fairly quickly to prepare such a welcome for us at such short notice , '' 
`` You 're not yet as old as I am , Horace , '' 
`` You 're quite right , '' 
`` So , all these precautions against intruders , Horace ... are they for the Death Eaters ' benefit , or mine ? '' 
`` I imagine that they would want you to turn your considerable talents to coercion , torture , and murder , '' 
`` Are you really telling me that they have n't come recruiting yet ? '' 
`` I have n't given them the chance . I 've been on the move for a year . Never stay in one place more than a week . Move from Muggle house to Muggle house -- the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands -- it 's been very pleasant , I 'll be sorry to leave . It 's quite easy once you know how , one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors do n't spot you bringing in the piano . '' 
`` Ingenious , '' 
`` If you 're going to tell me my life would be more peaceful at that pestilential school , you can save your breath , Albus Dumbledore ! I might have been in hiding , but some funny rumors have reached me since Dolores Umbridge left ! If that 's how you treat teachers these days -- '' 
`` Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd , '' 
`` It 's just -- I did n't like her either . '' 
`` No , I was wondering whether I might use your bathroom , '' 
`` Second on the left down the hall . '' 
`` No , I was merely reading the Muggle magazines , '' 
`` Well , I 'm sorry you do n't want the job , Horace , '' 
`` All right , all right , I 'll do it ! '' 
`` Wonderful , '' 
`` Well done , Harry , '' 
`` Horace , '' 
`` I tell you all this , '' 
`` not to turn you against Horace -- or , as we must now call him , Professor Slughorn -- but to put you on your guard . He will undoubtedly try to collect you , Harry . You would be the jewel of his collection ; ` the Boy Who Lived ' ... or , as they call you these days , ` the Chosen One . ' '' 
`` I 'd like a few words with you before we part . In private . Perhaps in here ? '' 
`` It was cruel , '' 
`` that you and Sirius had such a short time together . A brutal ending to what should have been a long and happy relationship . '' 
`` I 'll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can , and Voldemort too if I can manage it . '' 
`` Spoken both like your mother and father 's son and Sirius 's true godson ! '' 
`` A wise decision , on the whole , '' 
`` Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends , Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger . Yes , '' 
`` -- to worry or frighten them ? '' 
`` Oh , a little of this , a little of that , '' 
`` I think the word ` fiasco ' would be a good one here , '' 
`` Do n't count your owls before they are delivered , '' 
`` Well , I shall see you at Hogwarts , Harry , '' 
`` Take care of yourself . Molly , your servant . '' 
`` I do n't know exactly why he 's going to be giving me lessons , but I think it must be because of the prophecy . '' 
`` Come in , '' 
`` Ah , good evening , Harry . Sit down , '' 
`` So , Harry , '' 
`` And so I did , '' 
`` It has a very great deal to do with the prophecy , '' 
`` For a trip down Bob Ogden 's memory lane , '' 
`` He was employed by the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , '' 
`` He died some time ago , but not before I had tracked him down and persuaded him to confide these recollections to me . We are about to accompany him on a visit he made in the course of his duties . If you will stand , Harry ... '' 
`` No matter , Harry -- '' 
`` Now is not the moment for that story , Harry . Not yet . We have an appointment with Bob Ogden . '' 
`` After you , '' 
`` You understand him , I 'm sure , Harry ? '' 
`` Very good , '' 
`` Yes , indeed , '' 
`` Again , this is guesswork , '' 
`` but I believe that Merope , who was deeply in love with her husband , could not bear to continue enslaving him by magical means . I believe that she made the choice to stop giving him the potion . Perhaps , besotted as she was , she had convinced herself that he would by now have fallen in love with her in return . Perhaps she thought he would stay for the baby 's sake . If so , she was wrong on both counts . He left her , never saw her again , and never troubled to discover what became of his son . '' 
`` I think that will do for tonight , Harry , '' 
`` Very important , I think , '' 
`` Sir , am I allowed to tell Ron and Hermione everything you 've told me ? '' 
`` Yes , I think Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger have proved themselves trustworthy . But Harry , I am going to ask you to ask them not to repeat any of this to anybody else . It would not be a good idea if word got around how much I know , or suspect , about Lord Voldemort 's secrets . '' 
`` No , sir , I 'll make sure it 's just Ron and Hermione . Good night . '' 
`` Yes ? '' 
`` So I was , '' 
`` But is n't it ... sir , is n't it the same ring Marvolo Gaunt showed Ogden ? '' 
`` No , I acquired it very recently , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` Odd in what way ? '' 
`` Definitely , '' 
`` Nothing , '' 
`` Whatever , '' 
`` You mean he is a bully ? '' 
`` I should n't think so , no , '' 
`` You understand , I 'm sure , that we will not be keeping him permanently ? '' 
`` Very much , '' 
`` How do you do , Tom ? '' 
`` No , no , '' 
`` I am not from the asylum , '' 
`` Hogwarts , '' 
`` Magic ? '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` Well , you were quite right , '' 
`` All in good time , '' 
`` Open the door , '' 
`` Take it out , '' 
`` Is there anything in that box that you ought not to have ? '' 
`` Open it , '' 
`` You will return them to their owners with your apologies , '' 
`` At Hogwarts , '' 
`` we teach you not only to use magic , but to control it . You have -- inadvertently , I am sure -- been using your powers in a way that is neither taught nor tolerated at our school . You are not the first , nor will you be the last , to allow your magic to run away with you . But you should know that Hogwarts can expel students , and the Ministry of Magic -- yes , there is a Ministry -- will punish lawbreakers still more severely . All new wizards must accept that , in entering our world , they abide by our laws . '' 
`` I have n't got any money . '' 
`` That is easily remedied , '' 
`` In Diagon Alley , '' 
`` I 'm afraid I do n't know , '' 
`` All the details are on the second piece of parchment in your envelope , '' 
`` It is unusual , '' 
`` but not unheard of . '' 
`` I think that will do , '' 
`` Sit down , '' 
`` Yes , Tom Riddle was perfectly ready to believe that he was -- to use his word -- ` special , ' '' 
`` Did I know that I had just met the most dangerous Dark wizard of all time ? '' 
`` Time is making fools of us again , '' 
`` Yes , Harry ? '' 
`` But I thought you might have the mouth organ or something . '' 
`` Well , the start of the school year arrived and with it came Tom Tom Riddle , a quiet boy in his secondhand robes , who lined up with the other first years to be sorted . He was placed in Slytherin House almost the moment that the Sorting Hat touched his head , '' 
`` I have not been able to find many memories of Tom Riddle at Hogwarts , '' 
`` All he had to go upon was the single name ` Marvolo , ' which he knew from those who ran the orphanage had been his mother 's father 's name . Finally , after painstaking research through old books of Wizarding families , he discovered the existence of Slytherin 's surviving line . In the summer of his sixteenth year , he left the orphanage to which he returned annually and set off to find his Gaunt relatives . And now , Harry , if you will stand ... '' 
`` Because Morfin could not remember anything from that point onward , '' 
`` The Muggle authorities were perplexed . As far as I am aware , they do not know to this day how the Tom Riddles died , for the Avada Kedavra curse does not usually leave any sign of damage ... The exception sits before me , '' 
`` Enter , '' 
`` My dear Sybill , '' 
`` there is no question of throwing you unceremoniously from anywhere , but Harry does have an appointment , and I really do n't think there is any more to be said -- '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` Please close the door and sit down , Harry , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` Divination is turning out to be much more trouble than I could have foreseen , never having studied the subject myself . I can not ask Firenze to return to the forest , where he is now an outcast , nor can I ask Sybill Trelawney to leave . Between ourselves , she has no idea of the danger she would be in outside the castle . She does not know -- and I think it would be unwise to enlighten her -- that she made the prophecy about you and Voldemort , you see . '' 
`` But never mind my staffing problems . We have much more important matters to discuss . Firstly -- have you managed the task I set you at the end of our previous lesson ? '' 
`` I see , '' 
`` And did that work ? '' 
`` Thank you for saying that , Harry , '' 
`` I 'll do it , sir , I 'll get it from him , '' 
`` Then we shall say no more about it just now , '' 
`` but continue with our story where we left off . You remember where that was ? '' 
`` Very good , '' 
`` But now , Harry , '' 
`` now things become murkier and stranger . If it was difficult to find evidence about the boy Tom Riddle , it has been almost impossible to find anyone prepared to reminisce about the man Voldemort . In fact , I doubt whether there is a soul alive , apart from himself , who could give us a full account of his life since he left Hogwarts . However , I have two last memories that I would like to share with you . '' 
`` I shall then be glad of your opinion as to whether the conclusions I have drawn from them seem likely . '' 
`` I hope you are not tired of diving into other people 's memories , for they are curious recollections , these two , '' 
`` Deeply uneasy , '' 
`` Whose memory is it ? '' 
`` Mine , '' 
`` Enter . '' 
`` Good evening , Tom , '' 
`` I am glad you approve , '' 
`` I have come a long way . '' 
`` These days , I am known as -- '' 
`` I know what you are known as , '' 
`` But to me , I 'm afraid , you will always be Tom Tom Riddle . It is one of the irritating things about old teachers . I am afraid that they never quite forget their charges ' youthful beginnings . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` to a wizard such as myself , there can be nothing more important than passing on ancient skills , helping hone young minds . If I remember correctly , you once saw the attraction of teaching too . '' 
`` You call it ` greatness , ' what you have been doing , do you ? '' 
`` I have experimented ; I have pushed the boundaries of magic further , perhaps , than they have ever been pushed -- '' 
`` Of some kinds of magic , '' 
`` Perhaps you have been looking in the wrong places , '' 
`` Will you let me return ? Will you let me share my knowledge with your students ? I place myself and my talents at your disposal . I am yours to command . '' 
`` My friends , '' 
`` will carry on without me , I am sure . '' 
`` I am glad to hear that you consider them friends , '' 
`` Then if I were to go to the Hog 's Head tonight , I would not find a group of them -- Nott , Rosier , Mulciber , Dolohov -- awaiting your return ? Devoted friends indeed , to travel this far with you on LORD VOLDEMORT 'S REQUEST ` 445 ` a snowy night , merely to wish you luck as you attempted to secure a teaching post . '' 
`` Oh no , merely friendly with the local barmen , '' 
`` Now , Tom ... '' 
`` If you do not want to give me a job -- '' 
`` Of course I do n't , '' 
`` It is , '' 
`` No , nothing , '' 
`` I have ideas , '' 
`` but no more than that . '' 
`` I shall tell you , Harry , when you have retrieved that memory from Professor Slughorn , '' 
`` Was he after the Defense Against the Dark Arts job again , sir ? He did n't say ... '' 
`` Oh , he definitely wanted the Defense Against the Dark Arts job , '' 
`` Er -- well -- ghosts are transparent -- '' 
`` Quite correct , '' 
`` Well , we know that he tried to do just that , five years ago , '' 
`` But they could be anywhere in the world -- hidden -- buried or invisible -- '' 
`` I am glad to see you appreciate the magnitude of the problem , '' 
`` But firstly , no , Harry , not seven Horcruxes : six . The seventh part of his soul , however maimed , resides inside his regenerated body . That was the part of him that lived a spectral existence for so many years during his exile ; without that , he has no self at all . That seventh piece of soul will be the last that anybody wishing to kill Voldemort must attack -- the piece that lives in his body . '' 
`` Yes indeed , '' 
`` Yes , I think so , '' 
`` Yes , you have , '' 
`` I can love ! '' 
`` Big deal ! '' 
`` Yes , Harry , you can love , '' 
`` Yes -- just love , '' 
`` No , it does n't ! '' 
`` It is essential that you understand this ! '' 
`` You are protected , in short , by your ability to love ! '' 
`` Very good . Then I wish you to go and fetch your Invisibility Cloak and meet me in the entrance hall in five minutes ' time . '' 
`` I would like you to wear your cloak , please , '' 
`` That I am off into Hogsmeade for a drink , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` No matter , '' 
`` I can assist you again . '' 
`` It will not be necessary for us to enter , '' 
`` What do you think ? '' 
`` Not here , precisely , '' 
`` But his final destination -- and ours -- lies a little farther on . Come . '' 
`` Lumos , '' 
`` You see ? '' 
`` Yes , this is the place , '' 
`` It has known magic , '' 
`` This is merely the antechamber , the entrance hall , '' 
`` We need to penetrate the inner place ... Now it is Lord Voldemort 's obstacles that stand in our way , rather than those nature made ... '' 
`` Here , '' 
`` Harry , I 'm so sorry , I forgot , '' 
`` Oh , surely not . So crude . '' 
`` I rather think , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I said it was crude , '' 
`` Sometimes , however , it is unavoidable , '' 
`` I 'll do it , I 'm -- '' 
`` You are very kind , Harry , '' 
`` After me , I think , '' 
`` Let us walk , '' 
`` Be very careful not to step into the water . Stay close to me . '' 
`` Oh yes , '' 
`` Certainly we could , '' 
`` What the things are , you mean , '' 
`` Oh no ... I think the Horcrux is in the middle . '' 
`` Oho , '' 
`` Magic always leaves traces , '' 
`` sometimes very distinctive traces . I taught Tom Tom Riddle . I know his style . '' 
`` Voldemort would have been reasonably confident that none but a very great wizard would have been able to find the boat , '' 
`` It does n't look like it was built for two people . Will it hold both of us ? Will we be too heavy together ? '' 
`` Voldemort 's mistake , Harry , Voldemort 's mistake ... Age is foolish and forgetful when it THE CAVE ` 565 ` underestimates youth ... Now , you first this time , and be careful not to touch the water . '' 
`` Yes , I am sure you did , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` but we do not need to worry about them at the moment . '' 
`` Not while they are merely drifting peacefully below us , '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` I am sure that once we take the Horcrux , we shall find them less peaceable . However , like many creatures that dwell in cold and darkness , they fear light and warmth , which we shall therefore call to our aid should the need arise . Fire , Harry , '' 
`` Careful not to touch the water , '' 
`` I am not sure , '' 
`` Something more worrisome than blood and bodies , however . '' 
`` I can not touch , '' 
`` Out of the way , please , Harry , '' 
`` Oh yes . '' 
`` But how to reach it ? This potion can not be penetrated by hand , Vanished , parted , scooped up , or siphoned away , nor can it be Transfigured , Charmed , or otherwise made to change its nature . '' 
`` Oh , I doubt that it would work like that , '' 
`` Undoubtedly , '' 
`` this potion must act in a way that will prevent me taking the Horcrux . It might paralyze me , cause me to forget what I am here for , create so much pain I am distracted , or render me incapable in some other way . This being the case , Harry , it will be your job to make sure I keep drinking , even if you have to tip the potion into my protesting mouth . You understand ? '' 
`` You remember , '' 
`` the condition on which I brought you with me ? '' 
`` you have my orders . '' 
`` Because I am much older , much cleverer , and much less valuable , '' 
`` Your good health , Harry . '' 
`` How do you feel ? '' 
`` Can you hear me ? '' 
`` ... do n't like ... want to stop ... '' 
`` No ... '' 
`` It 's all right , I 'm here -- '' 
`` Make it stop , make it stop , '' 
`` Nothing 's happening to you , you 're safe , it is n't real , I swear it is n't real -- take this , now , take this ... '' 
`` Please , please , please , no ... not that , not that , I 'll do anything ... '' 
`` Just drink , Professor , just drink ... '' 
`` I want to die ! I want to die ! Make it stop , make it stop , I want to die ! '' 
`` Drink this , Professor . Drink this ... '' 
`` KILL ME ! '' 
`` Just drink this ... It 'll be over ... all over ! '' 
`` no , you 're not dead , you said it was n't poison , wake up , wake up -- Rennervate ! '' 
`` Rennervate -- sir -- please -- '' 
`` Water , '' 
`` Yes -- '' 
`` Aguamenti ! '' 
`` I am weak ... '' 
`` Do n't worry , I 'll get us back ... Lean on me , sir ... '' 
`` The protection was ... after all ... well-designed , '' 
`` We 're nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... Do n't worry ... '' 
`` I am not worried , Harry , '' 
`` We did it ! We got the Horcrux ! '' 
`` I 've been better , '' 
`` Sir -- it 's okay , sir , you 're going to be all right , do n't worry -- '' 
`` We need to get you up to the school , sir ... Madam Pomfrey ... '' 
`` No , '' 
`` It is ... Professor Snape whom I need ... But I do not think ... I can walk very far just yet ... '' 
`` Right -- sir , listen -- I 'm going to knock on a door , find a place you can stay -- then I can run and get Madam -- '' 
`` Severus , '' 
`` Very gratifying , '' 
`` We all like appreciation for our own hard work , of course . But you must have had an accomplice , all the same ... someone in Hogsmeade , someone who was able to slip Katie the -- the -- aaaah ... '' 
`` So poor Rosmerta was forced to lurk in her own bathroom and pass that necklace to any Hogwarts student who entered the room unaccompanied ? And the poisoned mead ... well , naturally , Rosmerta was able to poison it for you before she sent the bottle to Slughorn , believing that it was to be my Christmas present ... Yes , very neat ... very neat ... Poor Mr. Filch would not , of course , think to check a bottle of Rosmerta 's . Tell me , how have you been communicating with Rosmerta ? I thought we had all methods of communication in and out of the school monitored . '' 
`` Is n't that the secret method of communication the group that called themselves Dumbledore 's Army used last year ? '' 
`` Please do not use that offensive word in front of me , '' 
`` Yes , I do , '' 
`` Now , about tonight , '' 
`` I am a little puzzled about how it happened ... You knew that I had left the school ? But of course , '' 
`` Harry , come on . '' 
`` I must have missed it , '' 
`` Not to worry , not to worry , '' 
`` Well , then . So . The charges . Yes . '' 
`` I 'm sorry to interrupt what I 'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story -- '' 
`` I may be wrong , '' 
`` but I am sure that under the Wizengamot Charter of Rights , the accused has the right to THE HEARING ` 143 ` present witnesses for his or her case ? Is n't that the policy of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement , Madam Bones ? '' 
`` I brought her with me , '' 
`` We 'll be checking that . You 'll leave details of your parentage with my assistant , Weasley . Incidentally , can Squibs see dementors ? '' 
`` Very well , '' 
`` The odds on that must be very , very long , even Bagman would n't have bet -- '' 
`` Oh , I do n't think any of us believe the dementors were there by coincidence , '' 
`` It means that I think they were ordered there , '' 
`` Not if the dementors are taking orders from someone other than the Ministry of Magic these days , '' 
`` Then , '' 
`` we must ask ourselves why somebody within the Ministry ordered a pair of dementors into that alleyway on the second of August . '' 
`` If it is true that the dementors are taking orders only from the Ministry of Magic , and it is also true that two dementors attacked Harry and his cousin a week ago , then it follows logically that somebody at the Ministry might have ordered the attacks , '' 
`` Of course it is n't , '' 
`` I was merely expressing my confidence that this matter will not go uninvestigated . '' 
`` Of course we are , '' 
`` but the presence of dementors in that alleyway is highly relevant . Clause seven of the Decree states that magic may be used before Muggles in exceptional circumstances , and as those exceptional circumstances include situations that threaten the life of the wizard or witch himself , or witches , wizards , or Muggles present at the time of the -- '' 
`` Of course you are , '' 
`` If there were dementors , which I doubt -- '' 
`` You have heard from an eyewitness , '' 
`` But naturally , you would not care how many times you heard from a witness , if the alternative was a serious miscarriage of justice , '' 
`` A house-elf ! In a Muggle house ! I ask you -- '' 
`` The house-elf in question is currently in the employ of Hogwarts School , '' 
`` And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion , accepting , I presume , that even the best wizards can not always control their emotions , '' 
`` And I have n't even started on what he gets up to at school -- '' 
`` -- but as the Ministry has no authority to punish Hogwarts students for misdemeanors at school , Harry 's behavior there is not relevant to this inquiry , '' 
`` The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students , Cornelius , as I reminded you on the night of the second of August , '' 
`` Of course they can , '' 
`` As far as I am aware , however , '' 
`` there is no law yet in place that says this court 's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed . He has been charged with a specific offense and he has presented his defense . All he and I can do now is to await your verdict . '' 
`` Excellent , '' 
`` Tryouts for the House Quidditch teams will take place on the -- '' 
`` Thank you very much , Professor Umbridge , that was most illuminating , '' 
`` -- but you get these massive pus-filled boils too , '' 
`` Professor Grubbly-Plank says she is all well now , sir ! '' 
`` would it fill itself with chamber pots ? '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` No -- no , I 'll g-go , Dumbledore ! I sh-shall l-leave Hogwarts and s-seek my fortune elsewhere -- '' 
`` No , '' 
`` It is my wish that you remain , Sibyll . '' 
`` Oh , that wo n't be a problem , '' 
`` You 've found ? Might I remind you , Dumbledore , that under Educational Decree Twentytwo -- '' 
`` -- the Ministry has the right to appoint a suitable candidate if -- and only if -- the headmaster is unable to find one , '' 
`` And I am happy to say that on this occasion I have succeeded . May I introduce you ? '' 
`` This is Firenze , '' 
`` Thank you , Fortescue , that will do , '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` they certainly would be , if they had continued after the decree came into effect . Do you have any evidence that these meetings continued ? '' 
`` Oh , can she tell us about six months ' worth of meetings ? '' 
`` Just nod or shake your head , dear , '' 
`` I can not allow you to manhandle my students , Dolores , '' 
`` Dumbledore 's Army . '' 
`` Well , the game is up , '' 
`` Dumbledore 's Army , Cornelius , '' 
`` You ? '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` I did , '' 
`` Tonight was supposed to be the first meeting , '' 
`` Then you have been plotting against me ! '' 
`` That 's right , '' 
`` Be quiet , Harry , or I am afraid you will have to leave my office , '' 
`` Well , well , well -- I came here tonight expecting to expel Potter and instead -- '' 
`` Instead you get to arrest me , '' 
`` Ah , '' 
`` yes . Yes , I thought we might hit that little snag . '' 
`` Well , '' 
`` I 'm afraid I do . '' 
`` Do n't be silly , Dawlish , '' 
`` Merlin 's beard , no , '' 
`` Oh yes he will , Minerva ! '' 
`` Are you all right ? '' 
`` Unfortunately , I had to hex Kingsley too , or it would have looked very suspicious , '' 
`` It was foolish to come here tonight , Tom , '' 
`` We both know that there are other ways of destroying a man , Tom , '' 
`` You are quite wrong , '' 
`` Stay where you are , Harry ! '' 
`` If you proceed downstairs into the Department of Mysteries , Cornelius , '' 
`` Cornelius , I am ready to fight your men -- and win again ! '' 
`` Very well -- Dawlish ! Williamson ! Go down to the Department of Mysteries and see ... Dumbledore , you -- you will need CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX ` 818 ` to tell me exactly -- the Fountain of Magical Brethren -- what happened ? '' 
`` We can discuss that after I have sent Harry back to Hogwarts , '' 
`` I shall explain everything , '' 
`` when Harry is back at school . '' 
`` Portus . '' 
`` You have n't got authorization for that Portkey ! You ca n't do things like that right in front of the Minister of Magic , you -- you -- '' 
`` You will give the order to remove Dolores Umbridge from Hogwarts , '' 
`` You will tell your Aurors to stop searching for my Care of Magical Creatures teacher so that he can return to work . I will give you ... '' 
`` half an hour of my time tonight , in which I think we shall be more than able to cover the important points of what has happened here . After that , I shall need to return to my school . If you need more help from me you are , of THE ONLY ONE HE EVER FEARED ` 819 ` course , more than welcome to contact me at Hogwarts . Letters addressed to the headmaster will find me . '' 
`` I -- you -- '' 
`` Take this Portkey , Harry . '' 
`` I shall see you in half an hour , '' 
`` that Dumbledore will soon be back with us ? '' 
`` Thank you , '' 
`` Well , Harry , '' 
`` Madam Pomfrey is patching everybody up now , '' 
`` I know how you are feeling , Harry , '' 
`` Never try to understand the students . They hate it . They would much rather be tragically misunderstood , wallow in self-pity , stew in their own -- '' 
`` That 's enough , Phineas , '' 
`` What do n't I know ? '' 
`` You do care , '' 
`` Oh yes , you do , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` No , '' 
`` If you do n't -- if you keep me in here -- if you do n't let me -- '' 
`` By all means continue destroying my possessions , '' 
`` I daresay I have too many . '' 
`` Not until I have had my say , '' 
`` You will , '' 
`` It is my fault that Sirius died , '' 
`` Please sit down , '' 
`` Yes , Phineas , '' 
`` I guessed , fifteen years ago , '' 
`` when I saw the THE LOST PROPHECY ` 827 ` scar upon your forehead , what it might mean . I guessed that it might be the sign of a connection forged between you and Voldemort . '' 
`` Yes , '' 
`` More recently , '' 
`` I became concerned that Voldemort might realize that this connection between you exists . Sure enough , there came a time when you entered so far into his mind and thoughts that he sensed your presence . I am speaking , of course , of the night when you witnessed the attack on Mr. Weasley . '' 
`` Professor Snape , Harry , '' 
`` You see , '' 
`` I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind , to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts , and I was not eager to CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN ` 828 ` give him more incentives to do so . I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was -- or had ever been -- closer than that of headmaster and pupil , he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me . I feared the uses to which he would put you , the possibility that he might try and possess you . Harry , I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way . On those rare occasions when we had close contact , I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes ... I was trying , in distancing myself from you , to protect you . An old man 's mistake ... '' 
`` Voldemort 's aim in possessing you , as he demonstrated tonight , would not have been my destruction . It would have been yours . He hoped , when he possessed you briefly a short while ago , that I would sacrifice you in the hope of killing him . '' 
`` When , however , you did not return from your trip into the forest with Dolores Umbridge , Professor Snape grew worried that you still believed Sirius to be a captive of Lord Voldemort 's . He alerted certain Order members at once . '' 
`` She does n't give a damn -- '' 
`` But she took you , '' 
`` You sent that Howler . You told her to remember -- it was your voice -- '' 
`` I thought , '' 
`` that she might need reminding of the pact she had sealed by taking you . I suspected the dementor attack might have awoken her to the dangers of having you as a surrogate son . '' 
`` Five years ago , then , '' 
`` Yet there was a flaw in this wonderful plan of mine , '' 
`` I do n't -- '' 
`` I cared about you too much , '' 
`` We need to find her , '' 
`` What do you mean , Peeves ? '' 
`` Ashamed , Your Headship , sit . Does n't want to be seen . She 's a horrible mess . Saw her running through the landscape up on the fourth floor , sir , dodging between the trees . Crying something dreadful , '' 
`` Poor thing , '' 
`` Did she say who did it ? '' 
`` He got very angry when she would n't let him in , you see . '' 
`` I 'm afraid that , for your own safety , you will have to spend the night here . I want the prefects to stand guard over the entrances to the hall and I am leaving the Head Boy and Girl in charge . Any disturbance should be reported to me immediately , '' 
`` Oh , yes , you 'll be needing ... '' 
`` I do , Severus , '' 
`` It seems -- almost impossible -- that Black could have entered the school without inside help . I did express my concerns whet , you appointed -- '' 
`` I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have helped Black enter it , '' 
`` I must go down to the dementors , '' 
`` I 'm afraid the poor fellow is ill again , '' 
`` Is this a hospital wing or not ? Headmaster , I must insist -- '' 
`` My apologies , Poppy , but I need a word with Harry Potter and Miss Granger , '' 
`` Something about a rat , and Pettigrew being alive -- '' 
`` That , indeed , is Black 's story , '' 
`` It is your turn to listen , and I beg you will not interrupt me , because there is very little time , '' 
`` Yes , I do , '' 
`` What we need , '' 
`` Now , pay attention , '' 
`` I am going to lock you in . It is -- '' 
`` five minutes to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do it . Good luck . '' 
'' They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a tightly spiraling stone staircase . As they reached the bottom of it , they heard voices . They flattened themselves against the wall and listened . It sounded like Fudge and Snape . They were walking quickly along the corridor at the foot of the staircase . '' 
'' Harry panted . I do n't want to think about it ! '' 
`` I am going to lock you in , '' 
`` it is five minutes 353 to midnight . Miss Granger , three turns should do It . Good luck . '' 
`` Sirius has gone , on Buckbeak ... '' 
`` Well done . I think -- '' 
`` HE DID IT , I KNOW HE DID IT -- '' 
`` That will do , Severus , '' 
`` Well , there you have it , Severus , '' 
`` Oh , he 's not unbalanced , '' 
`` I thought it was my dad who 'd conjured my Patronus . I mean , when I saw myself across the lake ... I thought I was seeing him . '' 
`` An easy mistake to make , '' 
`` An extraordinary achievement -- not least , keeping it quiet from me . And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took , when it charged Lucius down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw . You know , Harry , in a way , you did see your father last night ... You found him inside yourself . '' 
`` We can only guess , '' 
`` Hagrid 's late . I suppose it was he who told you I 'd be here , by the way ? '' 
`` It 's the best place for him , '' 
`` Exactly , '' 
`` Ah , music , '' 
`` Obviously , you 've just done so , '' 
`` One can never have enough socks , '' 
`` Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n't get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . '' 
`` But this is important . '' 
'' she said finally . I do n't know how you found out about the Stone , but rest assured , no one can possibly steal it , it 's too well protected . '' 
`` Tokens from your friends and admirers , '' 
`` Yes , Yes , well done , Slytherin , '' 
`` Ahem , '' 
`` There are all kinds of courage , ''
